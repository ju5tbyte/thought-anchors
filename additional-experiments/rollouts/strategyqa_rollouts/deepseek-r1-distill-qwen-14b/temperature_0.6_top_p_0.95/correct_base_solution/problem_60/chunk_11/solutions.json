Question: Did Japanese serfdom have higher status than English counterpart?\n<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether Japanese serfdom had a higher status than the English counterpart. First, I should understand what serfdom was in both Japan and England. Serfdom was a social system where serfs were tied to the land and had to work for their lords. But the specifics might differ between regions. In Japan, during the Edo period, the social hierarchy was quite structured. The samurai were at the top, followed by farmers, then artisans, and merchants at the bottom. Serfs, or \"shokko,\" were at the lower end, similar to European serfs. Their status was low, but they were free in some aspects, like owning land and moving, which might have given them a slightly better position than European serfs who were more tied to the land. In England, the medieval period had serfs, often called villeins or bordars. They were part of the feudal system, bound to the land and required to work for their lords. Their status was low, but they had some rights, like the ability to work their own strips of land and participate in local governance through the manorial court. However, they were subject to the lord's will and could be forced to pay fees. Comparing the two, Japanese serfs had more freedom and could own property, which might have given them a higher status than their English counterparts. English serfs were more tied to the land and had fewer rights, making their status lower.
