Hmm, I remember that King James I was known for his interest in the supernatural. He wrote a book called \"Daemonologie,\" which I think is about demons and other supernatural creatures. Maybe that's where he talked about fairies? Wait, in folklore, fairies were often seen as magical beings, sometimes mischievous.

Also, I remember something about the \"Scottish Witch Trials\" during his reign.

But wait, did he explicitly say he despised them, or was it more about controlling the perception of them for political reasons?
