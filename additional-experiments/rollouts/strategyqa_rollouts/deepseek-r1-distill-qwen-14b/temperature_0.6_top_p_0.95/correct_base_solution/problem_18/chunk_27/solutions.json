    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins. I remember that the Seven Deadly Sins are a list of vices that have been recognized since early Christian times. The list includes pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. Each of these has been discussed in various religious and philosophical texts, and they're often seen as representing different aspects of human vice or moral failing. First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct. Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to definitively say it's the most prevalent. It's also possible that different sins are more prevalent in different contexts or among different groups.",

Question: Is greed the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins?\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins. I remember that the Seven Deadly Sins are a list of vices that have been recognized since early Christian times. The list includes pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. Each of these has been discussed in various religious and philosophical texts, and they're often seen as representing different aspects of human vice or moral failing. First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct. Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to definitively say it's the most prevalent. It's also possible that different sins are more prevalent in different contexts or among different groups. For example, in some communities, pride might be more of an issue, while in others, greed is more prominent.

I remember that the Seven Deadly Sins are a list of vices that have been recognized since early Christian times. The list includes pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. Each of these has been discussed in various religious and philosophical texts, and they're often seen as representing different aspects of human vice or moral failing. First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence.

First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct. Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to definitively say it's the most prevalent. It's also possible that different sins are more prevalent in different contexts or among different groups.",

Question: Is greed the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins?\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins. I remember that the Seven Deadly Sins are a list of vices that have been recognized since early Christian times. The list includes pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. Each of these has been discussed in various religious and philosophical texts, and they're often seen as representing different aspects of human vice or moral failing. First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions.

I remember that the Seven Deadly Sins are a list of vices that have been recognized since early Christian times. The list includes pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. Each of these has been discussed in various religious and philosophical texts, and they're often seen as representing different aspects of human vice or moral failing. First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct. Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to definitively say it's the most prevalent. It's also possible that different sins are more prevalent in different contexts or among different groups.",

Question: Is greed the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins?\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins. I remember that the Seven Deadly Sins are a list of vices that have been recognized since early Christian times. The list includes pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. Each of these has been discussed in various religious and philosophical texts, and they're often seen as representing different aspects of human vice or moral failing. First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct. Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to definitively say it's the most prevalent. It's also possible that different sins are more prevalent in different contexts or among different groups.

Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct. Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to definitively say it's the most prevalent. It's also possible that different sins are more prevalent in different contexts or among different groups. For example, in some cultures, greed might be a bigger issue due to economic pressures, while in others, pride or wrath might be more prevalent. Additionally, the way sins are measured could vary. Some might look at the impact on society, others on individual experiences. If we consider the economic systems of today, where material wealth and consumerism are significant drivers, greed could be more prominent in influencing societal behavior. The global financial crisis, for instance, was partly driven by greedy practices in banking and finance, which had widespread repercussions. This might suggest that greed has a substantial impact, making it more prevalent. On the other hand, other sins like envy or wrath might be more common in personal relationships, which are more numerous and thus could be more prevalent in that sense. It's also possible that the perception of prevalence is influenced by how much attention each sin receives in media and education. Greed is often a central theme in cautionary tales aimed at teaching moral lessons, which might skew perceptions of its prevalence. In conclusion, while greed is certainly a significant sin with a strong presence in cultural narratives and societal issues, determining whether it's the most prevalent among the Seven Deadly Sins is challenging without specific data. It likely depends on how one measures prevalence\u2014by frequency of occurrence, impact, or cultural discussion\u2014and the context in which it's being considered.\n</think>\n\nGreed is often highlighted in media, literature, and societal issues, suggesting its perceived significance. However, without concrete data, it's unclear if it's the most prevalent. Factors like cultural context, individual experiences, and societal impact influence perceptions, making it difficult to definitively label greed as the most prevalent sin. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct. Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to definitively say it's the most prevalent. It's also possible that different sins are more prevalent in different contexts or among different groups. For example, in some cultures, greed might be a bigger issue due to economic pressures, while in others, pride or wrath might be more prevalent. Additionally, the concept of prevalence can be subjective. Some people might prioritize certain sins over others based on their personal values or experiences. Therefore, while greed is certainly a significant sin, stating it's the most prevalent without evidence might not be accurate. It's safer to say that greed is a prevalent sin but perhaps not the most so across all contexts and populations.\n</think>\n\nThe question of whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins is subjective and depends on how prevalence is measured. While greed is frequently depicted in literature, media, and societal discussions, suggesting it is perceived as significant, there is no definitive data proving it is the most prevalent. Other sins like pride, wrath, and envy also have substantial societal impacts. Without concrete evidence, it's challenging to assert greed as the most prevalent.

Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to definitively say it's the most prevalent. It's also possible that different sins are more prevalent in different contexts or among different groups. For example, in some cultures, pride might be a bigger issue, while in others, greed could be more prominent. Additionally, the perception of which sin is most prevalent might be influenced by current events or societal trends. For instance, during economic downturns, greed might be more scrutinized, making it seem more prevalent. On the other hand, in times of social unrest, sins like wrath or envy might take center stage. In conclusion, while greed is certainly a significant and widely discussed sin, whether it's the most prevalent among the Seven Deadly Sins depends on how prevalence is measured and the context in which it's being considered. Without specific data, it's challenging to assert definitively, but cultural and media portrayals suggest it's a major concern.\n</think>\n\nThe question of whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins is complex and depends on how prevalence is defined. Greed, as the excessive desire for material wealth, is frequently portrayed in literature and media, suggesting it is a significant issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to conclusively determine it as the most prevalent. Other sins like pride, wrath, and envy also have their own roles and societal impacts. Therefore, while greed is notable, it's not definitively the most prevalent without further evidence.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins. I remember that the Seven Deadly Sins are a list of vices that have been recognized since early Christian times. The list includes pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. Each of these has been discussed in various religious and philosophical texts, and they're often seen as representing different aspects of human vice or moral failing. First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions.

Question: Is greed the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins?\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins. I remember that the Seven Deadly Sins are a list of vices that have been recognized since early Christian times. The list includes pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. Each of these has been discussed in various religious and philosophical texts, and they're often seen as representing different aspects of human vice or moral failing. First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct. Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to definitively say it's the most prevalent. It's also possible that different sins are more prevalent in different contexts or among different groups. For example, in some cultures, greed might be more of an issue due to economic pressures, whereas in others, pride or wrath might be more prominent. Additionally, the perception of which sin is most prevalent could be influenced by religious teachings, which might emphasize certain sins over others.

    "full_cot": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Is greed the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins?\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins. I remember that the Seven Deadly Sins are a list of vices that have been recognized since early Christian times. The list includes pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. Each of these has been discussed in various religious and philosophical texts, and they're often seen as representing different aspects of human vice or moral failing. First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct. Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to definitively say it's the most prevalent. It's also possible that different sins are more prevalent in different contexts or among different groups. For example, in economically challenging times, greed might be more noticeable, whereas in times of peace, other sins might come to the forefront. Additionally, cultural differences could influence which sin is considered more prevalent. In some cultures, greed might be seen as a significant issue, while in others, pride or wrath might be more prominent.

I remember that the Seven Deadly Sins are a list of vices that have been recognized since early Christian times. The list includes pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. Each of these has been discussed in various religious and philosophical texts, and they're often seen as representing different aspects of human vice or moral failing. First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct. Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue.

Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct. Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to definitively say it's the most prevalent. It's also possible that different sins are more prevalent in different contexts or among different groups. For example, in economically challenging times, greed might be more prevalent, while in other times, other sins might take precedence. Additionally, cultural differences could influence which sin is considered more prevalent. In some cultures, greed might be seen as a significant issue, while in others, other sins might be more emphasized. So, while greed is certainly a major sin and is often discussed, it's not clear if it's the most prevalent without more specific information. I think the answer would lean towards no, it's not definitively the most prevalent, but it's a close call.\n</think>\n\nThe Seven Deadly Sins include greed, along with pride, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. While greed is a significant and frequently discussed sin, especially in literature and media, determining its prevalence among all seven is challenging without specific data. Each sin affects individuals and society in different ways, and cultural perceptions can influence which sin is seen as more prevalent. Therefore, while greed is notable, it's not definitively the most prevalent.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins. I remember that the Seven Deadly Sins are a list of vices that have been recognized since early Christian times. The list includes pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. Each of these has been discussed in various religious and philosophical texts, and they're often seen as representing different aspects of human vice or moral failing. First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct. Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to definitively say it's the most prevalent. It's also possible that different sins are more prevalent in different contexts or among different groups.",

This could contribute to its perception as being more prevalent. On the other hand, some might argue that pride underlies many other sins, making it the most fundamental and perhaps the most prevalent in a more subtle way. But again, without specific prevalence data, it's challenging to compare them directly. Another angle to consider is the impact of each sin. Greed can lead to systemic issues like inequality, economic collapse, and environmental destruction, which have wide-reaching effects. This might make it seem more prevalent in terms of societal impact, even if individual instances aren't necessarily more frequent than other sins. Conversely, while wrath or envy might have more immediate interpersonal effects, their societal impact might be less widespread. So, considering the influence and the reach of greed, it might be seen as the most prevalent. However, I'm still not entirely sure. It's possible that other sins are equally or more prevalent, but greed's visibility and impact make it a strong candidate.

Question: Is greed the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins?\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins. I remember that the Seven Deadly Sins are a list of vices that have been recognized since early Christian times. The list includes pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. Each of these has been discussed in various religious and philosophical texts, and they're often seen as representing different aspects of human vice or moral failing. First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress.

Question: Is greed the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins?\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins. I remember that the Seven Deadly Sins are a list of vices that have been recognized since early Christian times. The list includes pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. Each of these has been discussed in various religious and philosophical texts, and they're often seen as representing different aspects of human vice or moral failing. First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct. Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to definitively say it's the most prevalent. It's also possible that different sins are more prevalent in different contexts or among different groups. For example, in some cultures, pride might be more of an issue, while in others, greed could be more prominent due to economic factors. Additionally, the way sins are measured can vary. Some might look at the impact on society, while others consider individual prevalence. If we consider the global economy and the emphasis on material wealth in many societies today, greed might indeed be more prevalent now than in the past. The pursuit of wealth and resources has led to various social and economic issues, which could support the idea that greed is a dominant sin. However, it's also important to note that the Seven Deadly Sins are not rigid categories but rather conceptual tools for understanding moral failings. They might not neatly align with modern psychological or sociological analyses. In conclusion, while greed is certainly a significant sin and is frequently discussed, it's challenging to definitively state that it's the most prevalent without specific data. It likely depends on various factors, including cultural context, individual behavior, and societal norms.\n</think>\n\nThe Seven Deadly Sins include greed, which is the excessive desire for material wealth.

But based on the information I have, I would lean towards greed being considered one of the most prevalent, if not the most, due to its frequent portrayal and the impact it has on various aspects of life.\n</think>\n\nThe question of whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins is complex and depends on how prevalence is measured. Greed, as the excessive desire for material wealth, is often highlighted in literature, media, and societal discussions, suggesting it is perceived as a significant issue. However, without concrete data, it's challenging to definitively label it as the most prevalent. Other sins like pride, wrath, and envy also have their own impacts and frequencies in different contexts. While greed is frequently discussed, it may not be the most prevalent without further evidence. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins. I remember that the Seven Deadly Sins are a list of vices that have been recognized since early Christian times. The list includes pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. Each of these has been discussed in various religious and philosophical texts, and they're often seen as representing different aspects of human vice or moral failing. First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct. Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to definitively say it's the most prevalent. It's also possible that different sins are more prevalent in different contexts or among different groups.",

Question: Is greed the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins?\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins. I remember that the Seven Deadly Sins are a list of vices that have been recognized since early Christian times. The list includes pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. Each of these has been discussed in various religious and philosophical texts, and they're often seen as representing different aspects of human vice or moral failing. First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct.

Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct. Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to definitively say it's the most prevalent. It's also possible that different sins are more prevalent in different contexts or among different groups. For example, in some cultures, greed might be more of an issue due to economic conditions, while in others, pride or wrath might be more prevalent. Additionally, the perception of which sin is most prevalent can be influenced by current events or societal trends. For instance, during economic downturns, greed might be more scrutinized, making it seem more prevalent. In conclusion, while greed is certainly a significant sin and frequently discussed, whether it's the most prevalent among all seven is debatable. It likely depends on various factors, including cultural context, individual experiences, and societal focus at any given time. Without specific data, it's challenging to assert definitively, but based on cultural and media portrayals, it might be considered one of the more prevalent ones.\n</think>\n\nThe question of whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins is subjective and depends on various factors such as cultural context, individual experiences, and societal focus. While greed is frequently discussed in media and literature, indicating its perceived significance, it is challenging to definitively state it as the most prevalent without concrete data. Other sins like pride, wrath, and envy also hold prominence in different contexts. Therefore, it is not clear-cut that greed is the most prevalent.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins. I remember that the Seven Deadly Sins are a list of vices that have been recognized since early Christian times. The list includes pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. Each of these has been discussed in various religious and philosophical texts, and they're often seen as representing different aspects of human vice or moral failing. First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct. Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to definitively say it's the most prevalent. It's also possible that different sins are more prevalent in different contexts or among different groups.",

Question: Is greed the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins?\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether greed is the most prevalent of the Seven Deadly Sins. I remember that the Seven Deadly Sins are a list of vices that have been recognized since early Christian times. The list includes pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. Each of these has been discussed in various religious and philosophical texts, and they're often seen as representing different aspects of human vice or moral failing. First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure. Pride is more about self-centeredness rather than a specific action like greed. Wrath, or anger, is another sin that could be prevalent, especially in interpersonal conflicts and violence. Envy, the desire for what others have, is also a common emotion that can lead to negative actions. Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct. Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to definitively say it's the most prevalent. It's also possible that different sins are more prevalent in different contexts or among different groups. For example, in economically challenging times, greed might be more prevalent, whereas in other times, other sins might take precedence. Additionally, cultural differences might influence which sin is considered more prevalent. In some cultures, greed might be seen as a major issue, while in others, other sins might be more emphasized. So, while greed is certainly a significant sin and often discussed, it's unclear if it's the most prevalent without more specific information.

Sloth, or laziness, might be less discussed but can affect personal productivity and societal progress. Gluttony and lust are also present in various forms, with gluttony often linked to issues like obesity and lust to sexual misconduct. Considering all these, greed does seem to be a frequent topic in media and literature, which might indicate it's perceived as a major issue. However, without concrete data, it's hard to definitively say it's the most prevalent. It's also possible that different sins are more prevalent in different contexts or among different groups. For example, in some cultures, pride might be more of an issue, while in others, greed might be more prominent due to economic conditions. Additionally, the way sins are taught and emphasized in religious or educational contexts could influence their perceived prevalence. In many Western societies, the Protestant work ethic and capitalist ideals might inadvertently promote a culture where the pursuit of wealth is highly valued, possibly making greed more visible or acceptable in certain contexts. This could contribute to its perception as a prevalent sin. On the other hand, other sins like envy or wrath might be more common in personal relationships, which are perhaps harder to measure on a societal level. So, while greed is certainly a significant sin and is frequently discussed, I'm not entirely convinced it's the most prevalent without more evidence. It might be more about the context and the values of the society in question.\n</think>\n\nThe Seven Deadly Sins\u2014pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust\u2014each represent different aspects of human vice.

I remember that the Seven Deadly Sins are a list of vices that have been recognized since early Christian times. The list includes pride, greed, wrath, envy, sloth, gluttony, and lust. Each of these has been discussed in various religious and philosophical texts, and they're often seen as representing different aspects of human vice or moral failing. First, I need to understand what makes one sin more prevalent than another. Prevalence could be measured in several ways: how often it's committed, how much it affects individuals or society, or how it's portrayed in literature and media. Greed, specifically, is the excessive desire for material wealth or gain. It's often associated with selfishness and the unfair acquisition of resources. I wonder if there's any data on the prevalence of each sin. Maybe through surveys or psychological studies. However, I don't recall specific data points off the top of my head. Instead, I might have to rely on cultural perceptions and the frequency with which each sin is discussed or depicted. Greed is a common theme in literature, movies, and news. Think about stories where characters are driven by avarice, like in \"The Great Gatsby\" or \"Wall Street.\" These narratives often highlight the negative consequences of greed, such as loss of relationships, moral decay, or societal collapse. This widespread portrayal might suggest that greed is perceived as a significant issue in society. On the other hand, other sins like pride, which is often considered the root of all sins, might be seen as more fundamental. Pride involves excessive self-esteem or narcissism, which can lead to other sins. But does that make it more prevalent? I'm not sure.
