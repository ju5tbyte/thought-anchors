I'm not super familiar with all his acting roles, but I know he's appeared in a few movies. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Keith Richards has been in some films, probably in cameos or small roles because he's more known as a musician. I think he was in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\" Was he in that one? I'm pretty sure he played a small part there. But wait, in that movie, he was part of a band, right? The film has a scene where there's a band playing in a bar, and I think Keith Richards was part of that group. So, was he the captain of a boat in that movie?\n\nNo, wait, in \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" the main character is Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp, and the captain of the ship is part of the plot. But Keith Richards' role was more of a musician, not a captain. So he wasn't the captain there.\n\nI'm trying to recall if he played a captain in any other movie. Maybe in \"The Rolling Stones: Some Girls\" or something? Or perhaps in a documentary? I'm not sure. I don't think he's had a role where he's the captain of a boat. His roles in movies are usually cameos or as himself, like in \"The Commitments\" or \"Almost Famous.\" \n\nWait, another thought: there's a movie called \"The Captain\" where someone plays a captain, but I don't think Keith Richards was in that. Or maybe \"The Perfect Storm,\" but I don't recall him being in that either.\n\nSo putting it all together, Keith Richards hasn't played a captain of a boat in a movie. His roles are more about music and cameos, not sea captains. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards, known primarily as a musician, has appeared in several movies, often in cameo roles. In \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,\" he played a musician in a bar scene, not a captain. Other roles, such as in \"The Commitments\" or \"Almost Famous,\" also do not involve him as a boat captain. There is no record of him playing a captain of a boat in any film. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",

I'm not super familiar with all his acting roles, but I know he's appeared in a few movies. Let me think about which ones they are.\n\nFirst, I remember that Keith Richards has been in some movies, maybe doing cameos or small roles. One that comes to mind is \"Pirates of the Caribbean.\" I think he played a small part in one of those movies. I believe it was \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.\" In that movie, there's a scene where a band is playing, and I think Keith Richards was part of that band. So he was playing a musician in that context. But was he the captain of a boat? I don't think so; he was just part of the band on the ship. So that's one point against him being a captain.\n\nAnother movie I recall is \"The Rolling Stones: Some Girls Are Missing.\" That's a documentary, though, so maybe not relevant here. There's also \"Rock 'n' Roll High School,\" but I'm not sure if he was in that one. I think that might have been more of a cameo by someone else, maybe another musician.\n\nWait, I also remember that in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,\" there was a scene with a band, and I'm pretty sure Keith Richards was part of that as well. But again, that's just as a musician, not as a captain. So in both \"Pirates\" movies I mentioned, he's playing a musician on a ship, not the captain.\n\nI'm trying to think if there's any other movie where he plays a captain. Maybe something more recent? I don't recall any other roles where he's leading a boat or a ship. Most of his acting roles seem to be cameos or small parts, often related to music or bands.\n\nSo putting it all together, Keith Richards has been in a couple of movies where he plays a musician on a ship, but he's not portrayed as the captain. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards has appeared in movies such as \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" and \"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,\" where he played a musician in a band on a ship, but he was not portrayed as the captain of the boat. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

I think he was in a movie called \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.\" In that movie, he played a character named Captain Teague.

So, the main one is \"Pirates of the Caribbean.\"\n\nWait, another thought: in the movie, is Captain Teague the captain of a specific boat, or is he more like a pirate king or leader without a specific ship?

Wait, no, that's Johnny Depp. Oh, right, Keith Richards actually played the character Bootstrap Bill in that movie. So he was in the first Pirates movie. But was he a captain in that? Bootstrap Bill was more of a crew member, if I recall correctly. He was tied to the mast or something like that. So maybe not as a captain there.\n\nThen there's \"The Rolling Stones: Some Girls\" movie from 1980. I think that's a concert film, so he's probably just performing in that, not acting as a captain. Probably not the case there.\n\nAnother movie I can think of is \"The Man with the Golden Arm\" from 1955, but I'm not sure if Keith Richards was even born then. Wait, he was born in 1948, so he was 7 years old in 1955. He definitely wasn't in that movie. Maybe I'm confusing him with someone else.\n\nI also remember hearing about a movie called \"Scorsese's The Last of Sheila,\" but I'm not sure if Keith Richards was in that. Maybe it's another actor. I think that's an older movie, from the 60s or 70s, so again, Keith might not have been in it.\n\nWait, there's also \"The Pirates! In an Adventure with Hatchet Hall\" from 2012. That's a computer-animated movie. I think Keith Richards provided the voice for a character, but I'm not sure if he's a captain there. Maybe it's a minor role, so I'm not certain.\n\nI'm trying to think if there's any other movie where he plays a captain. Maybe something more recent? Like \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\"? But I think that's still with Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow, and Keith Richards was in the first one as Bootstrap Bill. So probably not a captain role in any of them.\n\nI guess another way to check would be to look up his filmography. But since I can't do that right now, I'll have to rely on what I remember. From what I recall, Keith Richards hasn't played a captain in any of his movie roles. He's been in a few, but none where he's the captain of a boat.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I don't think Keith Richards has played a captain of a boat in a movie.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards has appeared in several movies, including \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\" where he played Bootstrap Bill, and \"The Rolling Stones: Some Girls.\" However, in none of these roles did he portray a captain of a boat. His roles have been as crew members or in concert films, not as a boat captain. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

I'm not sure.\n\nWait, I'm trying to think if there's a movie where he's specifically a boat captain. Maybe a documentary or something else? Or perhaps in a cameo? I don't recall any instance where he's portrayed a captain of a boat in a movie. Most of his roles seem to be as pirates or in other capacities, but not as the captain.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Keith Richards has acted in movies, but I don't think any of his roles have been as the captain of a boat. He might have been part of a crew or in a lower position, but not the captain. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards has appeared in several movies, including \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" where he played Scrum, a pirate, but not the captain. He has also been in other films like \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" but not as a boat captain. There is no evidence of him playing a captain in any movie. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",
