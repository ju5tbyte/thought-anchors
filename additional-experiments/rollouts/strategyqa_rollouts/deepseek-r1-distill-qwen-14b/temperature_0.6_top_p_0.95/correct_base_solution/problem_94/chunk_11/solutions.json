Wait, no, that's Johnny Depp's role. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh, right, Keith Richards actually played the role of Captain Teague in that movie. Captain Teague is the father of Jack Sparrow, so he's definitely a captain in the film. That seems to fit the question. But wait, did he play a captain in another movie? I think he's been in other movies too, like \"The Man with the Golden Arm\" or \"Blues Brothers 2000,\" but I'm not sure if he played a captain there. But since I already found that he was in \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" as a captain, that should be enough to answer the question.
