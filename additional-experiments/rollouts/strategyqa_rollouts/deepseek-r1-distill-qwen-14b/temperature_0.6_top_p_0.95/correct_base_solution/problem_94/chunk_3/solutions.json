Let me think about the ones I know. \n\nFirst, I remember that Keith Richards was in the movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\" I think he played a character named Bootstrap Bill. Wait, was that his role? I'm not entirely sure, but I think he had a part in that Disney movie. \n\nIn \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" the main characters are Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann. The story revolves around them dealing with the curse and the Black Pearl. Now, Bootstrap Bill is a character who is a pirate and is related to Jack Sparrow. He's a sort of father figure or mentor to Jack. \n\nSo, if Keith Richards played Bootstrap Bill, was he the captain of a boat? Well, Bootstrap Bill is a pirate, and pirates often have their own ships. I think in the movie, he's part of Jack's crew or at least a significant figure in the pirate world. But does he specifically captain a boat in the movie? \n\nI'm trying to recall the scenes. Bootstrap Bill is more of a supporting character who helps Jack and the others. He's not the main captain; Jack Sparrow is the main captain of the Black Pearl. So, while Bootstrap Bill is a pirate and part of a crew, he doesn't command his own ship in the movie. \n\nTherefore, Keith Richards didn't play a captain of a boat in that movie. He played a pirate, but not the captain. I don't think he has any other movie roles where he's a captain. \n\nSo, the answer should be no, he doesn't play a captain in any of his movies.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards appeared in the movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\" as Bootstrap Bill, a pirate and mentor to Jack Sparrow. While Bootstrap Bill is a significant pirate character, he does not serve as the captain of a boat in the film. His role is not that of a ship's captain, as the main captain in the movie is Jack Sparrow. Therefore, Keith Richards does not play a captain of a boat in this or any other movie.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

I'm not super familiar with all his acting roles, but I know he's appeared in a few movies. Let me think about the ones I know. \n\nFirst off, I remember him being in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\" In that movie, he plays a character named Jack Sparrow, right? Wait, no, that's Johnny Depp. Oh, right, Keith Richards plays a different character. Maybe it's someone like a pirate or a musician. I think he plays a musician in that movie, perhaps in the band with Jack Sparrow. But does he play a captain? I'm not sure. \n\nI also recall another movie where he appeared, maybe \"The Mountain\" or something else. But I'm not certain about the details. I should think about the roles he's had. He's known for his roles in \"Mick\" and \"Pirates\" as I mentioned. \n\nWait, in \"Pirates,\" he's in a scene where he's part of a pirate crew. So maybe he's a crew member, but not the captain. The captain role in that movie is played by someone else, like maybe Geoffrey Rush as Sparrow's rival. \n\nI should also consider if there's any other movie where he plays a captain. I'm trying to remember if there's a specific film where he's the captain of a boat. I don't recall any. Most of his roles seem to be as himself or as a musician in various movies. \n\nAnother thought: sometimes in documentaries or biopics, people play versions of themselves, but that's not acting as a different character. So unless there's a movie where he's specifically portrayed as a boat captain, the answer would likely be no. \n\nI think I can conclude that Keith Richards doesn't play a captain of a boat in any movie. His roles don't include that specific role.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards, the rock star, has appeared in several movies, including \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,\" where he plays a musician, and \"Mick,\" a biographical film about The Rolling Stones. In \"Pirates,\" he is part of a pirate crew but does not portray the captain. There is no evidence of him playing a captain of a boat in any movie. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",

Question: Does rock star Keith Richards play a captain of a boat in a movie?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether Keith Richards, the rock star, plays a captain of a boat in a movie. I'm not super familiar with all his acting roles, but I know he's appeared in a few movies. Let me think about the ones I know. \n\nFirst off, I remember he was in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.\" In that movie, he played a character named Bootstrap Bill. But wait, was he the captain? No, Bootstrap Bill was more like a crew member, right? The main captain in that movie was Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp. So, he wasn't the captain there.\n\nThen there's \"The Rolling Stones: Some Girls\" from 1980. That's a concert film, so he was part of the band performing, but I don't think he had a role where he was a captain. It was more about the music and their performances.\n\nI'm trying to recall if he's been in any other movies. There's also \"Shine a Light,\" a 2008 film where he played a character named Frank. Again, I don't remember him being a captain in that one. It was more of a music-themed movie, but not involving a boat.\n\nWait, maybe there's a documentary or a film where he's part of a boat scenario. But as far as I know, most of his roles are either as himself in documentaries or small parts in movies related to music. I don't recall any where he's the captain of a boat.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I don't think Keith Richards has played a captain of a boat in any movie.

It's a drama, so maybe not a boat role. \n\nI should check if there's any movie where he plays a captain. Maybe a smaller film I haven't heard of? Or perhaps a cameo? I don't recall any specific instance where he's portrayed a boat captain. His roles seem to be more as a supporting character, often in pirate or adventure movies, but not as the main captain. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I don't think Keith Richards has played a captain of a boat in any movie. He's been in several movies, but the roles I know don't include being a captain. I might be missing something, but based on what I remember, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards has appeared in several movies, including \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\" and \"At World's End,\" where he played Mr. Gibbs, a pirate, not a captain. He has also been in other films like \"The Rolling Stones: Some Girls\" and \"Rust and Bone,\" but none of these roles involved him being a captain of a boat. Therefore, based on the known roles, the answer is no.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

The captain might be someone else, like the main character played by someone else.\n\nWait, maybe in \"The Rolling Stones: Shine a Light,\" which is a concert film, but that doesn't involve a boat.\n\nAlternatively, I think he was in \"The Commitments,\" a movie about a band. But that's more about music, not a boat.\n\nI'm trying to recall if any of his roles involve him being a captain. Maybe in \"The Pirate Captain,\" but I don't think that's a real movie. Or perhaps in a documentary about sailing, but I don't think that's the case.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I don't think Keith Richards plays a captain of a boat in any movie. His roles are more related to music and being part of a crew, but not as the captain.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards has appeared in several movies, including \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,\" \"The Rolling Stones: Some Girls Tour '75,\" \"Mick Jagger: A Film About the Rolling Stones,\" \"The Man with One Red Eye,\" \"Pirate Radio,\" and \"The Commitments.\" In \"Pirate Radio,\" he plays a character named Bill Slater, a DJ on a boat, but he is not portrayed as the captain. Other roles, such as in documentaries, do not involve him as a boat captain. Therefore, there is no movie where Keith Richards plays a captain of a boat.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

    "full_cot": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Does rock star Keith Richards play a captain of a boat in a movie?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether Keith Richards, the rock star, plays a captain of a boat in a movie. I'm not super familiar with all his acting roles, but I know he's appeared in a few movies. Let me think about the ones I know. \n\nFirst, I remember that Keith Richards was in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\" He played a character named Jack Sparrow's father, Captain Teague. That's a pirate captain, so that's definitely a captain role. But wait, is that the only movie where he plays a captain?\n\nI think there might be another one. Oh, right, \"The Man with the Golden Arm.\" In that movie, he plays a character named Frank, and I believe he's part of a motorcycle gang. I don't think he's a captain there, though. It's more of a supporting role without any captaincy.\n\nAre there any other movies where he plays a captain? I'm trying to recall.

That's a big role, and he definitely portrayed a captain there. But wait, the question is about being a captain of a boat. So in that movie, he's a pirate captain, which is a type of boat captain, right? So that might count.\n\nBut I also recall that in \"Pirates,\" he's more of a pirate leader rather than a traditional boat captain. I'm not sure if that's the only movie where he plays a captain. Are there others? I think he was in \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" as well, but I don't remember him being a captain there. He played a character named Dikko, who was an agent, not a captain.\n\nI should check if there are any other movies where he plays a captain. Maybe in \"Rock Star,\" but I don't think he's a captain in that one. He's more of a manager or something like that. \n\nWait, but in \"Pirates,\" he's definitely a captain, even if it's a pirate ship. So the answer would be yes because he did play a captain of a boat, albeit a pirate ship. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes people might not consider a pirate captain a traditional boat captain, but technically, he was in charge of a boat, so it should count.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Keith Richards does play a captain of a boat in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\" Therefore, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards plays the role of Jack Sparrow in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,\" where he is the captain of a pirate ship. While his role is as a pirate captain rather than a traditional boat captain, he is indeed the captain of a boat in that film. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Question: Does rock star Keith Richards play a captain of a boat in a movie?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether Keith Richards, the rock star, plays a captain of a boat in a movie. I'm not super familiar with all his acting roles, but I know he's appeared in a few movies. Let me think about the ones I know. \n\nFirst, I remember him being in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\" He played a pirate named Jack Sparrow, right? Wait, no, that's Johnny Depp's character. Oh, right, Keith Richards actually played a different pirate in that movie. I think he was Bill Turner, but I'm not entirely sure. \n\nWait, Bill Turner is the father of Jack Sparrow, so that's a significant role. But does he play a captain in that movie? I don't recall him being the captain of a boat. Jack Sparrow is the captain, and Bill Turner is more like a father figure or a leader of the crew, but not the captain in the traditional sense. \n\nI also think Keith Richards appeared in another movie, maybe \"The Rolling Stones: Some Girls.\" That's a documentary, so probably not a role where he plays a captain. \n\nAnother thought: sometimes celebrities play versions of themselves in movies. If he played himself as a captain, that could be a possibility. But I don't recall any movie where he's portrayed as a boat captain. \n\nWait, maybe in \"RKO 288\"? I think that's a movie where he played a character named Ace, but I'm not sure if that role involved being a captain of a boat. \n\nI'm trying to think if there's any other movie where he has a significant role that involves being a captain. I don't think so. Most of his roles seem to be as pirates or supporting characters, but not as a boat captain. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I don't think Keith Richards plays a captain of a boat in any movie.
