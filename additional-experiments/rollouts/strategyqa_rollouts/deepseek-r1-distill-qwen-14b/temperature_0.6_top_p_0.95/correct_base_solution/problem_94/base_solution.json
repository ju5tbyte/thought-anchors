  "prompt": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Does rock star Keith Richards play a captain of a boat in a movie?\n<think>\n",
  "solution": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether Keith Richards, the rock star, plays a captain of a boat in a movie. I'm not super familiar with all his acting roles, but I know he's appeared in a few movies. Let me think about the ones I know.\n\nFirst, I remember that Keith Richards was in the movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\" He played a character named Jack Sparrow, right? Wait, no, that's Johnny Depp's role. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh, right, Keith Richards actually played the role of Captain Teague in that movie. Captain Teague is the father of Jack Sparrow, so he's definitely a captain in the film. That seems to fit the question.\n\nBut wait, did he play a captain in another movie? I think he's been in other movies too, like \"The Man with the Golden Arm\" or \"Blues Brothers 2000,\" but I'm not sure if he played a captain there. However, the main one I remember is \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" where he was definitely a captain.\n\nSo putting it all together, yes, Keith Richards does play a captain of a boat in the movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\" He's the father of Jack Sparrow, and his character is the captain. Therefore, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards plays the role of Captain Teague in the movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,\" where he is the captain of a boat. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",
