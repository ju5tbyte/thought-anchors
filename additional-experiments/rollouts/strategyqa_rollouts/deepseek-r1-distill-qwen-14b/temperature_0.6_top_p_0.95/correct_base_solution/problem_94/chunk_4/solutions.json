Oh, right, that's the one. So in that movie, Keith Richards plays Bootstrap Bill, who is a pirate, but not the captain. The captain in that movie is Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp.\n\nSo, does Keith Richards play a captain in any movie? Maybe another movie? I'm trying to recall if he's ever portrayed a boat captain. There's also the movie \"The Legend of Robin Hood,\" but I don't think he was in that. Or maybe \"The Mountain,\" but that's more of a music documentary. Wait, there's another movie called \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,\" the second one. Did he have a role there? I think he did, but again, it's not as the captain. He might have been part of the crew or another pirate, but not the captain.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm confusing him with another actor. I should check if there's any other movie where he plays a captain. Wait, I think in \"The Wild,\" an animated movie, he provided the voice for a character named Captain, but I'm not sure if that counts as a boat captain. Or perhaps in a documentary or another film. Alternatively, maybe in a cameo role, but I can't recall any specific instance where he's the captain of a boat.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Keith Richards is known for playing Bootstrap Bill in the first Pirates movie, but not as a captain. He's appeared in other movies, but I don't think any of them feature him as the captain of a boat. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards is known for his role as Bootstrap Bill in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,\" but he does not play a captain of a boat in that movie or any other film. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",

The yacht is central to the plot, and there's a lot of tension and mystery. So, was he the captain? I'm not certain. I think his role was more as a musician and part of the ensemble, not necessarily the captain.\n\nWait, maybe in \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" he had a more prominent role as a captain. But no, I think in that movie, he was just another pirate, not the captain. The captain role was played by someone else, like maybe Geoffrey Rush as the pirate captain.\n\nI'm trying to remember if there's any other movie where he plays a captain. I don't recall any others. He's appeared in a few other films, like \"Blues Brothers 2000,\" but I don't think he played a captain there either. So, putting it all together, it seems like Keith Richards hasn't played a captain of a boat in any of his movies. He's been in roles that involve boats, like in \"The Last of Sheila,\" but not as the captain.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards has appeared in several movies, including \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\" as Bootstrap Bill Turner and \"The Last of Sheila\" as Richard. In \"The Last of Sheila,\" he plays a character on a yacht, but not as the captain. He has not played a captain of a boat in any of his movies. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",

Maybe it's in a documentary or a cameo. Alternatively, perhaps in a movie where he's playing himself. Wait, in \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" he's not the captain, but in \"The Man with One Red Socket,\" which is a 1985 film, I believe he plays a character named Lucky, and I think he's the captain of a ship in that movie. Let me confirm that. Yes, in \"The Man with One Red Socket,\" Keith Richards stars as Lucky, who is the captain of a boat. So, yes, he does play a captain of a boat in that movie.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards plays the role of Lucky, the captain of a boat, in the 1985 film \"The Man with One Red Socket.\" Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

I'm not super familiar with all his acting roles, but I know he's appeared in a few movies. Let me think about the ones I know. First, I remember that Keith Richards was in the movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\" He played a character named Jack Sparrow, right? Wait, no, that's Johnny Depp who played Jack Sparrow. So maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh, right, Keith Richards actually played another character in that movie. I think he had a small role as a pirate. \n\nWait, but was he the captain of a boat? In \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" there are several pirate captains. Jack Sparrow is the main one, but there's also Barbossa, played by Geoffrey Rush. Maybe Keith Richards played one of the other pirates, but not the captain. Let me think if there's another movie where he plays a captain. I'm trying to recall if there's any other film where he's in a boat-related role. \n\nAnother movie I think he was in is \"The Rolling Stones: Some Girls\" or something like that, but that's more of a documentary or concert film, not a fictional movie where he plays a character. Then there's \"Rust and Bone,\" but I don't think that involves a boat or a captain role. \n\nWait, maybe \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" is the only movie where he's in a boat scene, and he's not the captain there. So perhaps he doesn't play a captain of a boat in any movie. I'm trying to remember if there are any other movies. Maybe \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\"?

In \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" he was Scrum, a pirate, but not the captain. So he wasn't the captain of a boat in that movie. Are there any other roles where he plays a captain? I'm not sure. I don't recall any other movies where he takes on that role.\n\nWait, perhaps in \"The Blues Brothers\"? No, that's Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. Keith Richards did play a small role in that movie, but I don't think he was the captain. He was more of a cameo appearance. So no, he wasn't the captain there either.\n\nI'm trying to think if there's any other movie where he's the captain of a boat. Maybe in a documentary or a cameo, but nothing comes to mind. So, based on what I know, Keith Richards hasn't played a captain of a boat in any movie. He's been in a few movies, but the roles I remember don't include being a captain. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards has appeared in several movies, including \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,\" where he played the character Scrum, a pirate, but not the captain. He also had a cameo in \"The Blues Brothers\" but did not portray a captain. There is no known role where he plays the captain of a boat in a movie. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",

I'm not super familiar with all his acting roles, but I know he's appeared in a few movies. Let me think about the ones I know. First, I remember that Keith Richards was in the movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\" He played a character named Jack Sparrow, right? Wait, no, that's Johnny Depp. Oh, no, wait, in that movie, Keith actually played a pirate named Jack, but I think it's a different Jack. Maybe Jack the Monkey? Or was that a different role? Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no, I think in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,\" which is the fifth movie in the series, Keith Richards did play a character named Jack, but I'm not sure if it's the captain. I think he had a small role as a pirate captain in that movie. So, if that's the case, then yes, he did play a captain of a boat in a movie. But I'm not 100% certain. Let me try to recall more details. In that movie, he had a brief appearance as a pirate, and I think his character was a captain. So, putting it all together, I think the answer is yes.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards appeared in the movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\" as a pirate captain, a small but notable role.
