Or was that another character? No, the Black Pearl was captained by Bootstrap Bill. Keith's character was more like a pirate lord or a leader, not necessarily the captain of a specific boat. So maybe he wasn't the captain in that sense.\n\nAlternatively, is there another movie where he plays a boat captain? I'm trying to think of other roles. Maybe in \"The Love Bug\" or some comedy? I don't think so. I think his main role was in the Pirates movie as Captain Teague.\n\nSo, putting it together: Keith Richards did play a character named Captain Teague in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,\" but I'm not sure if that counts as being the captain of a boat or more of a pirate leader. I think the question is asking if he's the captain of a boat, so maybe it's a bit of a stretch, but he did have a leadership role in a pirate context.\n\nWait, but in the movie, he's the father of Jack Sparrow and a pirate captain, so maybe yes, he was the captain of a boat in that role. So the answer would be yes, he does play a captain of a boat in a movie.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards plays the character Captain Teague in the movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.\" While his role is primarily as a pirate leader, he is associated with a boat as part of his pirate captain persona. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

I'm not super familiar with all his acting roles, but I know he's appeared in a few movies over the years. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Keith Richards has acted in some films, often in roles that tie into his own life or interests. One of the more well-known ones is \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\" where he played the character Scrum. That was a pretty big role, and it's a pirate-themed movie, which is related to boats, but he wasn't the captain there. He was more of a sidekick or a crew member.\n\nThen there's \"The Man with One Red Socket,\" a 1995 film where he had a small role. I'm not sure what his character was exactly, but I don't recall him being a captain in that movie. It might have been a minor part, so maybe he wasn't the captain there either.\n\nI also think about \"Rust and Bone,\" a 2012 movie where he played a supporting role. Again, I don't remember him being a captain in that one. His role was more of a lover or friend to the main character, I think.\n\nAnother movie I can think of is \"The Last of Sheila,\" a 1973 mystery film. Keith Richards was in that one too, but I don't think he played a captain. His role was probably more involved with the plot's twists and turns rather than being in command of a boat.\n\nWait, there's also \"Pirate Radio,\" a 2009 film about a pirate radio station. Keith Richards was in that, but again, I don't recall him being the captain. Maybe he was part of the crew or a musician in the film.\n\nI'm trying to remember if any of these roles involved him being the captain of a boat. None of the ones I can think of specifically mention him as the captain. He's often in roles that are part of a larger ensemble, but not necessarily in command of a vessel.\n\nI should also consider if there are any lesser-known or smaller roles where he might have played a captain. Maybe in a documentary or a TV show, but the question is about a movie. I don't think there's a widely recognized movie where he's the captain of a boat.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Keith Richards has acted in several movies, often in roles related to music or pirate themes, but I don't recall any where he was the captain of a boat.

I think his role is more of a musician or a crew member. Maybe he's part of the band that plays in the ship's band. That would make sense because he's a musician in real life.\n\nI'm trying to think if there are any other movies where he plays a captain. I don't remember any others. He's appeared in \"The Doors\" as well, but that's more of a supporting role, and I don't think he's a captain there either.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Keith Richards has acted in movies, but I don't think he's ever played a captain of a boat. His role in \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" was more of a musician or crew member, not the captain. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards, the rock star from The Rolling Stones, has appeared in several movies, including \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,\" where he plays a character named Jack. However, his role in this film is not as the captain of a boat but rather as a musician or crew member. There is no evidence of him playing a captain in any other movies. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

I think he had a cameo in that movie, but I'm not certain if he was the captain.\n\nLet me think more about \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.\" Johnny Depp was in that movie as Jack Sparrow, and there were other characters too. I think Bill Nighy was in it as Davy Jones, and maybe others. I'm trying to remember if Keith Richards had a role as a captain. I think he did play a character named Captain Teague, who was the father of Jack Sparrow. So, in that role, he was a captain, but I'm not 100% sure if that's accurate.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing it with another movie. Did he play a captain in another film? I don't recall any other movies where he's a captain. He might have been in \"The Doors\" as Jim Morrison, but that's a different role. Or maybe in \"Rust and Bone,\" but I think that was more of a supporting role.\n\nSo, putting this together, I think Keith Richards did play a captain in a movie, specifically in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\" as Captain Teague. That would mean the answer is yes. But I'm a bit unsure because I'm not 100% certain about the details of his role in that movie.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards, the legendary guitarist of The Rolling Stones, has appeared in several movies, primarily in cameo roles. One notable appearance is in the 2006 film \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,\" where he played Captain Teague, the father of Jack Sparrow. In this role, he indeed portrayed a captain of a boat. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Question: Does rock star Keith Richards play a captain of a boat in a movie?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Keith Richards, the rock star from The Rolling Stones, plays a captain of a boat in a movie. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all his acting roles, but I know he's appeared in a few movies. Let me think about which ones he's been in.\n\nI remember he was in a movie called \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.\" In that movie, he played a character named Bootstrap Bill Turner. Wait, was he the captain? No, I think Bootstrap Bill was more of a pirate and not the captain. The captain in that movie was Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp. So Keith wasn't the captain there.\n\nAnother movie he was in is \"The Beaver.\" I don't recall him being a boat captain in that one; it's more of a drama about a guy with mental issues. Maybe there's another movie where he plays a captain. I'm trying to think if he's ever been in any nautical-themed films beyond \"Pirates.\" I don't think so. He's been in some documentaries and maybe some cameos, but not as a boat captain.\n\nI guess if I'm not sure, I can look up his filmography. From what I remember, his roles aren't typically as captains of boats. He's more known for his music and cameos in movies, but not as a main character in a boat captain role. So, putting it all together, I don't think Keith Richards plays a captain of a boat in any movie.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards has appeared in several movies, including \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" as Bootstrap Bill Turner and \"The Beaver.\" However, he does not play a captain of a boat in any of these films. His roles are not typically as boat captains. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",

Let's start by recalling what I know about Keith Richards. He's a well-known musician, guitarist, and singer. Beyond music, I think he's been involved in some acting roles, maybe in documentaries or movies related to The Rolling Stones.\n\nFirst, I'll think about any movies he's been in. I remember that he appeared in a documentary called \"Crossfire: The Bronx\" in 1982, which was about The Rolling Stones. But that's a documentary, not a fictional movie. Then there's \"The Doors\" movie from 1987, but I don't think he was in that one.

Pirate Radio was about a group of DJs broadcasting from a ship off the coast of England during the 1960s. In that movie, Richards played a character named Captain \"Dirk\" Diggler. So, in this role, he was indeed the captain of a boat, specifically a ship used for broadcasting pirate radio.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if that's accurate. I think the movie's title is \"Pirate Radio\" and it's based on the British radio station Radio Caroline. Keith Richards was in that movie, and his role was as a pirate radio DJ, but was he the captain? Or was he just a regular crew member? I might be mixing up the details.\n\nLet me think again. In \"Pirate Radio,\" the main characters are DJs on a ship. Keith Richards played a character named Captain Diggler, who was the leader or the captain of the ship. So yes, he did portray a captain of a boat in that movie. Therefore, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards, the rock star from The Rolling Stones, appeared in the 2009 movie \"Pirate Radio,\" where he played the role of Captain \"Dirk\" Diggler.

Let's start by recalling what I know about Keith Richards. He's a well-known musician, guitarist, and singer. Beyond music, I think he's been involved in some acting roles, maybe in documentaries or movies related to The Rolling Stones.\n\nFirst, I'll think about any movies he's been in. I remember that he appeared in a documentary called \"Crossfire: The Bronx\" in 1982, which was about The Rolling Stones. But that's a documentary, not a fictional movie. Then there's \"The Doors\" movie from 1987, but I don't think he was in that one. Wait, no, that's about Jim Morrison and The Doors, not The Rolling Stones.\n\nAnother movie I can think of is \"Pirate Radio\" from 2009. I believe Keith Richards was in that movie. Pirate Radio was about a group of DJs broadcasting from a ship off the coast of England during the 1960s. In that movie, Richards played a character named Captain \"Dirk\" Diggler. So, in this role, he was indeed the captain of a boat, specifically a ship used for broadcasting pirate radio.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if that's accurate. I think the movie's title is \"Pirate Radio\" and it's based on the British radio station Radio Caroline. Keith Richards was in that movie, and his role was as a pirate radio DJ, but was he the captain? Or was he just a regular crew member? I might be mixing up the details.\n\nLet me think again. In \"Pirate Radio,\" the main characters are DJs on a ship. Keith Richards played a character named Captain Diggler, who was the leader or the captain of the ship. So yes, he did portray a captain of a boat in that movie. Therefore, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards, the rock star from The Rolling Stones, appeared in the 2009 movie \"Pirate Radio,\" where he played the role of Captain \"Dirk\" Diggler. In this film, he portrayed the captain of a ship used for broadcasting pirate radio. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

I'm not super familiar with all his acting roles, but I know he's appeared in a few films. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Keith Richards has acted in some movies, often in roles that tie into his own interests or lifestyle. For example, he's been in documentaries about The Rolling Stones and has appeared in some biopics related to their music. But I'm not sure if he's ever played a captain in a boat-related movie.\n\nI think about some of the movies he's been in. There's \"Pirate Radio\" from 2009, which is about a pirate radio station. In that movie, I believe he played a character named 'The Pirate,' but I'm not sure if that role involved him being a captain of a boat. The movie is set on a ship, so maybe he did portray someone in charge. But I'm not certain if 'The Pirate' is equivalent to a captain.\n\nAnother movie I recall is \"The Doors\" from 1991, where he played Jim Morrison's father, which doesn't involve a boat. There's also \"Rock 'n' Roll High School\" from 1980, but that's more of a comedic film, and I don't think he had a significant role there.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other movies where he might have played a boat captain. Maybe in a documentary or a cameo? I don't remember any specific instances where he was the captain of a boat. Most of his roles seem to be smaller parts or cameos rather than leading roles.\n\nI think \"Pirate Radio\" is the closest, but I'm not entirely sure if his character was a captain. If he was part of a group on a ship, perhaps he was the leader, but the title of captain might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe the term \"pirate\" in the movie is more about the radio aspect rather than a boat captain.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while Keith Richards has acted in movies, I don't recall him playing a captain of a boat. His roles don't seem to include that specific title or role. Therefore, the answer is likely no.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards has appeared in several movies, including \"Pirate Radio,\" but his roles do not include playing a captain of a boat. His character in \"Pirate Radio\" is named 'The Pirate,' but this does not equate to a captain role. Therefore, he has not played a captain in a movie.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

I'm not sure. Maybe he's in another one.\n\nWait, there's also a movie called \"The Legend of Ron Burgundy,\" where he plays a character named Ed. That's a comedy, and I don't think he's a captain there. \n\nI think I've seen Keith Richards in \"The Doors,\" the movie about the rock band The Doors. In that movie, he plays Jim Morrison's friend, but I don't think he's a captain in that role. \n\nOh, maybe in \"Anh's Brush with Death\"? I'm not sure about that one. I don't recall him being a captain there either. \n\nWait, there's a movie called \"The Captain,\" but I don't think he's in that one. Alternatively, maybe in \"The Rocker,\" but that's more about a musician turning into a rock star, not a boat captain. \n\nI'm trying to remember if he's ever played a captain. Maybe in a documentary or a cameo. I think he might have a small role in a movie where he's a captain, but I can't recall the exact title. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in a movie where he's part of a boat scene, but not necessarily as the captain. Maybe in \"The Wild Life,\" but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, I think I've heard that he plays a captain in a movie, but I can't remember which one. Maybe it's in a more recent film. I'm going to try to think of any movies he's been in where he's in a boat or on a ship. \n\nOh, I think I've seen him in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.\" But in that movie, he plays a pirate, not a captain. Or maybe in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,\" but again, not as a captain. \n\nWait, there's a movie called \"The Big Lebowski,\" but I don't think he's in that one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in \"The Joneses,\" but that's about a family, not a boat. \n\nI'm trying to remember if there's a specific movie where he's a captain. Maybe in a horror or adventure film. \n\nWait, perhaps in \"The Kraken Wave.\" I'm not sure, but I think that's a movie where he plays a captain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" but I don't think he's a captain there. \n\nI'm a bit confused. I think I need to verify if he's ever played a captain in a movie. From what I can recall, he hasn't played a major role as a captain, but maybe in a cameo or a lesser-known film. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in \"The Rolling Stones: Some Girls,\" which is a documentary, but that's not a movie where he's a captain. \n\nWait, I think I might be mixing up some details. Let me try to think again. \n\nI'm pretty sure Keith Richards has acted in several movies, but I can't pinpoint a specific one where he's a captain of a boat. Maybe it's a movie I haven't seen or a role I don't remember. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in a movie called \"The Captain,\" but I don't think he's in that one. \n\nI'm not entirely sure, but I think the answer is no. He hasn't played a captain of a boat in a movie. Maybe I'm confusing him with another actor. \n\nWait, maybe in \"The Rocker,\" he plays a character named Buddy Blue, but that's a musician, not a captain. \n\nI think I'll go with no, Keith Richards hasn't played a captain of a boat in a movie.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards, the rock star from The Rolling Stones, has appeared in several movies, but there is no notable role where he plays a captain of a boat. While he has acted in films like \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" and \"The Doors,\" these roles do not involve him being a captain. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",
