Captain Teague is the father of Jack Sparrow, so he's definitely a captain in the film. That seems to fit the question. But wait, did he play a captain in another movie? I'm trying to recall if there were any other roles where he was a captain. I think he might have been in other movies, but I'm not sure if any of them had him as a boat captain. I'll check my memory: there's also \"The Doors,\" where he played Jim Morrison, but that's not a captain role. And \"Shine a Light,\" which is a documentary, so probably not. So, based on what I remember, Keith Richards played Captain Teague in \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" which would make him a captain in that movie. Therefore, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards appeared in the movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\" as Captain Teague, a role where he played the father of Jack Sparrow. This role makes him a captain in the film. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Captain Teague is the father of Jack Sparrow, so he's definitely a captain in the film. That seems to fit the question. But wait, did he play a captain in another movie? I think there's another one where he played a pirate captain, maybe in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.\" Or was that a different character? I'm a bit confused. Let me check my memory again. In \"The Curse of the Black Pearl,\" he was the pirate leader, the father figure. So yes, he was a captain there. So the answer should be yes because he played a captain in that movie.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards plays the role of Captain Teague in the movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,\" where he is the father of Jack Sparrow. Therefore, he does portray a captain of a boat in a movie.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",
