So, in that role, he would be a captain, right? So that would mean yes, he plays a captain in that movie.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because sometimes in movies, especially sequels, characters have various roles. So, I should confirm if Captain Teague is indeed considered a boat captain. Well, he's the father of a pirate captain, so he's probably a naval captain or something similar. That makes sense.\n\nI don't recall him playing any other captains in other movies, but \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" is a well-known one where he has a notable role. So, putting it all together, the answer should be yes because he played Captain Teague in that movie, who is a captain of a boat.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards played the role of Captain Teague in the movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.\" Captain Teague is a naval captain and the father of Jack Sparrow. Therefore, he indeed plays a captain of a boat in a movie.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Question: Does rock star Keith Richards play a captain of a boat in a movie?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether Keith Richards, the rock star, plays a captain of a boat in a movie. I'm not super familiar with all his acting roles, but I know he's appeared in a few movies. Let me think about the ones I remember.\n\nFirst, I know Keith Richards is a member of The Rolling Stones, and he's been in the music industry for a long time. But he's also acted in some films. The main ones I can think of are \" Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl \" and its sequels. In those movies, he plays the character Bill Turner, who is a pirate, not exactly a captain, but more of a pirate captain maybe? Wait, in the first movie, Bill Turner is a pirate, but I'm not sure if he's referred to as a captain.\n\nAnother movie I remember is \"The Man with One Red Eye.\" I think he played a supporting role there, but I don't recall it being a captain of a boat. Maybe in \"The Wild,\" which is another movie where he appears, but again, I'm not sure if he's a captain in that one.\n\nWait, there's also \"The Glimmer Man,\" where he plays a character named Charlie. But that's a different role; I don't think he's a boat captain there either.\n\nHmm, so focusing back on \"Pirates of the Caribbean.\" Bill Turner is a pirate, but in that context, he's more of a pirate leader rather than a captain of a boat. The term \"captain\" in movies can sometimes be used interchangeably with \"leader,\" but I'm not sure if Keith Richards' character is specifically called a captain in that role.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other movies where he might have played a captain. Maybe \"Rock Star,\" but that's about a band, and I don't think he plays a captain there. Or \"The Joneses,\" but that's a different kind of role.\n\nWait, another thought: in \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" there's a character named Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp, who is definitely a captain. Bill Turner is more of a pirate, but I think in the sequels, he might have a leadership role, but I'm not sure if he's called a captain.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Keith Richards plays Bill Turner in the \"Pirates\" series, who is a pirate, not specifically a captain of a boat. Therefore, the answer would be no, he doesn't play a captain of a boat in a movie.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards plays Bill Turner in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" series, who is a pirate but not specifically referred to as a captain of a boat. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

Question: Does rock star Keith Richards play a captain of a boat in a movie?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether Keith Richards, the rock star, plays a captain of a boat in a movie. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all his acting roles, but I know he's appeared in a few movies. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, Keith Richards is primarily known as a guitarist and a founding member of The Rolling Stones. But I remember he's also acted in some films. I think he's had roles in movies like \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" and maybe some others. Wait, did he play a captain in any of them?\n\nIn \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,\" he plays Captain Teague, the father of Jack Sparrow. That seems like a significant role, and he's definitely a captain there. So that would answer the question in the affirmative. But wait, is that the only movie where he plays a captain? I'm not sure, but I think that's the main one.\n\nI should also consider if there are other movies where he might have played a captain, but I don't recall any others. Maybe in some documentaries or cameos? Probably not a major role where he's a captain.

Let me start by recalling what I know about Keith Richards. He's a guitarist known for The Rolling Stones, right? He's been in the music scene for a long time, and I think he's also acted in some movies or TV shows.\n\nI remember seeing him in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.\" Wait, was he in that one? I think he played a character named Captain Teague. But was he the captain of a boat? In the movie, he was the father of Jack Sparrow, I believe. Jack Sparrow is a pirate captain, so maybe Teague was a higher authority, like a pirate king or something. But was he the captain of a specific boat?\n\nI'm not entirely sure if he was the captain of a boat or just a pirate leader. I think his role was more about being a leader of pirates rather than commanding a specific ship. Also, I don't recall any other movies where he plays a boat captain. He's appeared in a few other films, like \"The Commitments\" and \"Shuckers,\" but I don't think those roles involved him being a captain of a boat.\n\nSo, putting it together, while Keith Richards did play a pirate leader in \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" it doesn't seem like he was the captain of a specific boat in that movie. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards, the guitarist for The Rolling Stones, appeared in the movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" as Captain Teague. While Teague is a pirate leader and the father of Jack Sparrow, he is not depicted as the captain of a specific boat in the film. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

I think he's appeared in a few movies, maybe cameos or smaller roles. One that comes to mind is \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.\" I remember Johnny Depp was in that movie as Jack Sparrow, and Keith Richards was in the same franchise, but I'm not sure what role he played.\n\nWait, in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,\" Keith Richards played Captain Teague. That sounds familiar. So, if he played a captain, then he was the captain of a boat in that movie. But I need to confirm if that's accurate.\n\nLet me think about the movie. In \"Dead Man's Chest,\" there's a character named Captain Teague who is the father of Bootstrap Bill. He's a significant character because he's Bootstrap Bill's father and is involved in the plot as a former pirate. Keith Richards portrayal of this character would mean he's playing a captain of a boat, as captains command ships.\n\nI should also consider if there are other movies where he might have played a captain. I know he's appeared in other films like \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" and \"Blues Brothers 2000,\" but I don't recall him playing a captain role in those. It's more likely that \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" is the movie where he took on the role of a captain.\n\nTo be thorough, I can think about other movies he's been in. For example, he had a cameo in \"The Commitments\" as himself, but that's not a captain role. In \"Blues Brothers 2000,\" he played a blues musician, not a captain. So, the most plausible movie where he plays a captain is \"Dead Man's Chest.\"\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, Keith Richards does play a captain of a boat in the movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.\" So the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards, the rock star and member of The Rolling Stones, has appeared in several movies, including \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,\" where he played the role of Captain Teague. This character is indeed a captain of a boat within the context of the film. Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

But maybe Keith Richards had a small role in that or another Pirates movie.\n\nAnother thought: There's a movie called \"The Captain\" which is about a big wave surfer. I'm not sure if Keith Richards is in that, but it's a stretch. Maybe he's in a documentary or a music-related film. Wait, there's also \"Shine a Light,\" a concert film where he performs with The Rolling Stones. But that's more of a performance than acting.\n\nI think I've heard that Keith Richards played a small role in a movie where he was the captain of a boat. Maybe it's a lesser-known film. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cameo where he's in a boat scene, but not necessarily as the captain.\n\nWait, I'm trying to recall. There's a movie called \"The Big Lebowski.\" No, that's more about Jeff Bridges and the Coen Brothers. Not related to boats or captains. Maybe \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\"? No, that's more of a crime thriller.\n\nAnother angle: Keith Richards has a memoir called \"Life,\" and maybe that was adapted into a movie. But I don't think he plays a captain there. Alternatively, perhaps in a biopic of The Rolling Stones, but again, not sure about a boat captain role.\n\nI'm not entirely certain, but I think I've heard somewhere that Keith Richards did play a captain in a movie. Maybe it's in a film where he's part of a boat crew or a small role in a nautical-themed movie. I'm not 100% sure, but I'm leaning towards yes because I think I've heard of it before, even if I can't remember the exact title.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards, the legendary guitarist of The Rolling Stones, has appeared in several movies, primarily in cameo roles. One notable film where he plays a captain is \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,\" where he portrays Captain Teague, the father of Jack Sparrow. This role fits the description of him being a captain in a movie.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Instead, I think his role was more of a musician and anti-hero type.\n\nSo, if he was in \"Riff-Raff\" as Barry Blue, but not as a captain of a boat, then the answer would be no. I don't think he's played a captain in any of his movie roles. Maybe I'm confusing him with another actor who has played a boat captain in a movie.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes rock stars appear in movies in non-acting roles, like cameos or as themselves. But even then, I don't think he's been a captain of a boat. Maybe in a documentary about boats or sailing? I don't recall that either.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other movies he's been in. I think he was in \"The Commitments\" as a supporting character, but that's more of a musician role again, not a captain. So, putting it all together, I don't think Keith Richards has played a captain of a boat in any movie.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards, the guitarist and co-founder of The Rolling Stones, has appeared in a few movies, primarily in roles related to music or as himself. One notable role is in the 1980 film \"Riff-Raff,\" where he played the character Barry Blue, a musician and anti-hero. However, this role does not involve him being a captain of a boat. There is no evidence of him playing a boat captain in any of his film roles. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

So he was on a boat, but was he the captain? I don't think so; Gibbs was more like a crew member under Jack Sparrow.\n\nThen there's \"The Mayor of the Sunset Strip.\" I think he played himself in that movie. But that's more of a cameo, and he's not really a captain there, just being himself. \n\nAnother movie I recall is \"Absolute Beginners.\" He was in that too, but I'm not sure about the role. I think it was set in the music scene, but again, I don't remember him being a captain of a boat in that one.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up some details. Did he ever play a captain in any other films? I can't think of any off the top of my head. Most of his roles seem to be as himself or as a musician, not as a boat captain. \n\nI should also consider if there are any documentaries or other films where he might have portrayed a captain, but I don't think so. His acting roles are limited, and the ones I know don't include a captain role on a boat.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I don't think Keith Richards has played a captain of a boat in a movie. He's been in a few, but the roles don't fit that description.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards has appeared in several movies, including \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\" as a pirate named Gibbs, and \"The Mayor of the Sunset Strip\" where he played himself. However, in none of these roles did he portray a captain of a boat. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",
