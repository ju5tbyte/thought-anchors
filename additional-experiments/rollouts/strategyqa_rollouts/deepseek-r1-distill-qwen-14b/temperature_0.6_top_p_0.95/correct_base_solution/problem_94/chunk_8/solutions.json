    "full_cot": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Does rock star Keith Richards play a captain of a boat in a movie?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether Keith Richards, the rock star, plays a captain of a boat in a movie. I'm not super familiar with all his acting roles, but I know he's appeared in a few movies. Let me think about the ones I know. First, I remember that Keith Richards was in the movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\" He played a character named Jack Sparrow, right? Wait, no, that's Johnny Depp's role. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh, right, Keith Richards actually played the role of Captain Teague in that movie. Captain Teague is the father of Jack Sparrow, so he's definitely a captain in the film. \n\nNow, I'm trying to remember if he was the captain of a boat in that role. In \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" Captain Teague is the leader of the Brethren Court, which is like a council of pirate captains. So, he's a captain, but does he command a specific boat in the movie? I think he's more of a leader figure rather than actively sailing a ship in that particular movie. But he is a captain, so maybe that counts. \n\nAre there any other movies where he plays a captain? I'm trying to recall if he's been in any other films where he's a boat captain. I don't think so. Most of his acting roles are smaller parts, and \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" is the most prominent one. So, putting it all together, Keith Richards does play a captain in that movie, even if he's not actively sailing a boat in it. Therefore, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nKeith Richards plays the role of Captain Teague in the movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\" While he is a pirate captain and part of the Brethren Court, he does not actively command a specific boat in the film.

Question: Does rock star Keith Richards play a captain of a boat in a movie?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether Keith Richards, the rock star, plays a captain of a boat in a movie. I'm not super familiar with all his acting roles, but I know he's appeared in a few movies. Let me think about the ones I know.

Captain Teague is the father of Jack Sparrow, so he's definitely a captain in the film. That seems to fit the question because he's portrayed as a captain of a boat. I don't recall him playing another captain in any other movies, but I'm pretty sure \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" is the main one.
