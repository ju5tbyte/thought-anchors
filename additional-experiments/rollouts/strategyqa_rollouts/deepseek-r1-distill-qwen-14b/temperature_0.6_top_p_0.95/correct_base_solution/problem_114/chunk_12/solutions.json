I think each lane is about 12 feet wide, and there are maybe 8 lanes in total. So, 8 lanes would be 8 * 12 = 96 feet wide. Wait, that can't be right because the bridge is much wider than that. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check. Oh, I think I forgot that the bridge has two roadways, each with multiple lanes. So, if each direction has, say, 4 lanes, that's 4 * 12 = 48 feet per direction. So, the total width would be 48 feet for each side, totaling 96 feet. But that still doesn't add up because the bridge's actual width is about 90 feet between the two roadways, but each roadway is wider. Wait, maybe each lane is 12 feet, and there are 6 lanes each way. So, 6 lanes * 12 feet = 72 feet per direction. So, total width would be 72 feet for each side, making it 144 feet wide overall. If that's the case, then 110.5 feet of trucks would fit within that 144 feet. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 110 is almost 77% of 144, which might still leave some space, but it's getting close. Also, I should consider the clearance and the fact that vehicles need some space between them, not just the width. If the trucks are parked side by side exactly, maybe they could fit, but in reality, traffic lanes have buffer zones. So, 13 trucks taking up 110 feet might exceed the available width if each direction is only 72 feet. Alternatively, maybe the Golden Gate Bridge is wider than I thought. Let me think again. I've read that the Golden Gate Bridge is 90 feet wide between the two roadways, with each roadway being 32 feet wide, including six traffic lanes and two shoulders. Wait, that would mean each roadway is 32 feet, so two roadways would be 64 feet total. But that seems too narrow. I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the actual dimensions. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I'll try to remember. I think each direction has six lanes, each 12 feet wide, so 6 * 12 = 72 feet per direction. So, the total width of the bridge would be 72 feet for one direction and another 72 feet for the other, totaling 144 feet. If that's the case, then 13 trucks at 8.5 feet each would take up 110.5 feet. Since 110.5 is less than 144, they could fit. But wait, the bridge has two separate roadways, so maybe each side is 72 feet. So, if all 13 trucks were on one side, that's 110.5 feet, which is more than 72 feet, meaning they wouldn't all fit on one side. But the question says \"side by side,\" so perhaps they are arranged across both roadways. If the total width is 144 feet, then 110.5 is less than that, so they could fit. But in reality, traffic is divided into two directions, so you can't have all 13 trucks on one side. They would have to be split, which complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the question is just about the width, not the actual traffic flow. So, if the bridge is 144 feet wide, and the trucks take up 110.5 feet, they could fit in a single direction, but in reality, traffic is moving, so having 13 trucks parked side by side would block the bridge.

So, if each direction has, say, 4 lanes, that's 4 * 12 = 48 feet per direction. So, the total width would be 48 feet for each side, totaling 96 feet. But that still doesn't add up because the bridge's actual width is about 90 feet between the two roadways, but each roadway is wider. Wait, maybe each lane is 12 feet, and there are 6 lanes each way. So, 6 lanes * 12 feet = 72 feet per direction. So, total width would be 72 feet for each side, making it 144 feet wide overall. If that's the case, then 110.5 feet of trucks would fit within that 144 feet. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 110 is almost 77% of 144, which might still leave some space, but it's getting close. Also, I should consider the clearance and the fact that vehicles need some space between them, not just the width. If the trucks are parked side by side exactly, maybe they could fit, but in reality, traffic lanes have buffer zones. So, 13 trucks taking up 110 feet might exceed the available width if each direction is only 72 feet. Alternatively, maybe the Golden Gate Bridge is wider than I thought. Let me think again. I've read that the Golden Gate Bridge is 90 feet wide between the two roadways, with each roadway being 32 feet wide, including six traffic lanes and two shoulders. Wait, that would mean each roadway is 32 feet, so two roadways would be 64 feet total. But that seems too narrow. I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the actual dimensions. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I'll try to remember. I think each direction has six lanes, each 12 feet wide, so 6 * 12 = 72 feet per direction. So, the total width of the bridge would be 72 feet for one direction and another 72 feet for the other, totaling 144 feet. If that's the case, then 13 trucks at 8.5 feet each would take up 110.5 feet. Since 110.5 is less than 144, they could fit. But wait, the bridge has two separate roadways, so maybe each side is 72 feet. So, if all 13 trucks were on one side, that's 110.5 feet, which is more than 72 feet, meaning they wouldn't all fit on one side. But the question says \"side by side,\" so perhaps they are arranged across both roadways. If the total width is 144 feet, then 110.5 is less than that, so they could fit. But in reality, traffic is divided into two directions, so you can't have all 13 trucks on one side. They would have to be split, which complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the question is just about the width, not the actual traffic flow. So, if the bridge is 144 feet wide, and the trucks take up 110.5 feet, they could fit in a single direction, but in reality, traffic is moving, so having 13 trucks parked side by side would block the bridge. Wait, but the question is about whether they would jam up the bridge, meaning cause a blockage. So, if 13 trucks are parked side by side, even if they fit in width, they would block the entire bridge, preventing any other vehicles from passing. Therefore, yes, they would jam up the bridge.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen is 13 items, so 13 Mac Trucks, each about 8.5 feet wide, would take up 110.5 feet.

Therefore, they would likely cause a jam because there's not enough space for all 13 to be side by side on the bridge. But wait, maybe the bridge's total width is more than the road. Let me think again. The bridge's total width, including everything, might be wider, but the actual road width is 90 feet. So, even if the bridge is wider, the road is 90 feet. So, 130 feet is still more than that. So, yes, they would jam up the bridge.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge has a road width of approximately 90 feet, consisting of six lanes. A baker's dozen refers to 13 items, so 13 Mac Trucks, each about 10 feet wide, would span 130 feet. Since 130 feet exceeds the bridge's 90-foot road width, the trucks would not fit side by side, leading to a jam.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm guessing a standard semi-truck is about 8.5 feet wide, but Mac Trucks might be a bit wider because they're built for heavy-duty use. Let's say each is around 9 feet wide. So, 13 trucks side by side would be 13 times 9 feet, which is 117 feet wide. Wait, that seems really wide. The Golden Gate Bridge's total width is about 90 feet, I think. So, 117 feet is wider than the bridge itself. That would mean the trucks wouldn't fit side by side across the bridge. But maybe the bridge has multiple lanes, so they could be spread out across them. If the bridge has, say, 8 lanes, then 13 trucks would need more than 8 lanes. So, even if they are spread out, 13 trucks would probably take up more lanes than available. Also, traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge is usually pretty busy, so adding 13 large trucks side by side would likely cause a traffic jam. Plus, the bridge's design might not be built to handle that many large vehicles in one area at once, potentially causing safety issues.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? Mac Trucks are about 11.5 feet wide, if I'm not mistaken. So, 13 of them side by side would be 13 multiplied by 11.5 feet. Let me do that math: 13 times 10 is 130, and 13 times 1.5 is 19.5, so total is 149.5 feet. Wow, that's almost 150 feet wide. Now, the Golden Gate Bridge is about 90 feet wide for the road, but I might be mixing that up. Wait, no, the total width including the two side walkways is around 100 feet. So, if the road itself is about 80 feet wide, and each lane is, say, 12 feet wide, that's 6 lanes (72 feet) plus some shoulders. But if 13 Mac Trucks take up 149.5 feet, that's way wider than the bridge's road. That means they wouldn't fit side by side on the bridge. So, even if they tried to line them up, they'd need a much wider space than the bridge provides. Therefore, they would definitely jam up the bridge because there's just not enough width to accommodate all 13 trucks side by side.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen refers to 13 items.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually about 8 to 10 feet wide. So, if each is around 9 feet wide, 13 of them side by side would be 13 times 9, which is 117 feet. That seems really wide. The Golden Gate Bridge's deck is about 90 feet wide, I believe. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Maybe it's wider. Let me think again. I think the total width from one side to the other is about 1,760 feet, but that's the length, not the width. The actual road deck is probably around 80 feet wide. So, if each Mac Truck is 9 feet wide, 13 would take up 117 feet, which is wider than the bridge's 80-foot deck. That would mean they wouldn't all fit side by side on the bridge. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says \"side by side,\" so perhaps they're arranged in a line, not all trying to be on the bridge at the same time. But even so, the bridge's width might not allow 13 trucks to pass without causing a jam. Also, considering traffic flow, even if the bridge is wide enough, having 13 large trucks moving across at the same time might cause congestion.

Even if they can't all fit side by side, maybe they could cause congestion because each one takes up a lot of space and time to pass. Alternatively, maybe the question is more about the physical space. Since 13 trucks at 10 feet each take up 130 feet, and the bridge is only 102 feet wide, they physically can't all be on the bridge at the same time side by side. So, they'd have to go one after another, which would take time, but not necessarily \"jam up\" the bridge. Jamming might imply that they block each other so that no one can pass, but if they go sequentially, it's just a traffic delay, not a complete jam. But maybe the question is more about whether they can all fit, which they can't, so they would cause a blockage. Alternatively, considering the length of the trucks. Mac Trucks are long, maybe 50-60 feet each. So, even if they go one after another, each taking up 60 feet, 13 of them would be 780 feet long, which is much longer than the bridge itself. So, they can't all be on the bridge at the same time, but they could cause a backup on the approaches. So, in that sense, yes, they would jam up the bridge because they can't all cross quickly and would cause a significant backup. Alternatively, maybe the question is more about the width, and since 13 trucks can't fit side by side, they would block the bridge. So, putting it all together, yes, a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks side by side would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge because they can't all fit at once, leading to congestion.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen is 13 items. Mac Trucks are large, each about 10 feet wide. The Golden Gate Bridge's deck is 102 feet wide, with 16-foot lanes totaling 96 feet for traffic. Thirteen trucks at 10 feet each would require 130 feet, exceeding the bridge's width. This means they can't fit side by side, causing congestion as they must pass sequentially, leading to a backup. Therefore, yes, they would jam up the bridge.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians.

If a Mac Truck is similar, maybe a bit wider because it's a heavy-duty model, perhaps around 9 or 10 feet. So, 13 trucks at 9 feet each would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet. Wait, that seems too wide. Maybe the lanes are wider. Alternatively, perhaps the bridge's lanes are designed for cars and smaller vehicles, so maybe each lane is about 12 feet wide. If each lane is 12 feet, how many lanes are there? Let's say there are 8 lanes total, divided into four in each direction. So, four lanes in each direction, each 12 feet wide, would make 4 * 12 = 48 feet in total width for one direction. But wait, the question is about side by side, so 13 trucks placed next to each other would require 13 * (width of each truck). If each truck is 8.5 feet wide, that's 13 * 8.5 = 110.5 feet. Now, the Golden Gate Bridge's total width is about 90 feet across the main span, but that's including all the lanes and maybe the sidewalks. Wait, I think the bridge has two main decks: the upper deck for cars and the lower deck for trains. The upper deck has six lanes, so three in each direction. Each lane is about 12 feet wide, so 3 lanes * 12 feet = 36 feet in one direction. But if we're considering all six lanes, it's 6 * 12 = 72 feet. So, if the upper deck is 72 feet wide, and we have 13 trucks each taking up 8.5 feet, that's 110.5 feet. That's way wider than the 72 feet of the bridge. So, 13 trucks side by side would require 110.5 feet, which is more than the 72 feet available on the upper deck. Therefore, they wouldn't all fit side by side on the bridge. Wait, but maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. If the bridge's upper deck is 72 feet wide for all six lanes, each lane is 12 feet. So, if you have 13 trucks, each needing, say, 10 feet, that's 130 feet. The bridge's upper deck is only 72 feet wide. So, 130 feet is much wider than 72 feet. Therefore, they wouldn't fit all side by side. Alternatively, maybe the question is about whether they would cause a traffic jam, not physically fitting. Even if they can't fit all at once, maybe they would block traffic as they pass. But the question specifically asks if they would jam up the bridge, implying whether they can fit.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? Let's say each truck is about 10 feet wide. So, 13 trucks side by side would be 130 feet wide. Wait, that seems really wide. The bridge's lanes are much narrower than that. For example, a typical traffic lane is about 12 feet wide. If the bridge has, say, six lanes in each direction, that's 72 feet wide total. But wait, 130 feet is way more than that. So, even if all the trucks were lined up side by side, they wouldn't fit within the bridge's width because the bridge isn't that wide. Also, the Golden Gate Bridge is designed to handle heavy traffic, but having 13 trucks parked side by side on it would likely block all lanes, causing a major traffic jam. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact measurements, so maybe I should double-check. I think the bridge's total width is around 90 feet, with each lane being about 12 feet. So 13 trucks at 10 feet each would be 130 feet, which is wider than the bridge.

That seems impossible because the bridge's road isn't that wide. So, 13 Mac Trucks side by side would require a width greater than the bridge's road can provide. Therefore, they wouldn't fit. Also, considering the height of the trucks and the bridge's clearance, but I think the main issue is the width.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not exactly sure, but a standard semi-truck trailer is about 8.5 feet wide. If a Mac Truck is similar, then 13 of them side by side would be 13 times 8.5 feet. Let me do that math: 13 * 8.5 = 110.5 feet. So, the total width would be about 110.5 feet. Now, what's the width of the Golden Gate Bridge's road? I looked it up before, and I think it's about 90 feet wide for the road, including all lanes. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because 90 feet for 13 trucks would be too tight. Maybe I'm confusing the total bridge width with the road width. The bridge itself is about 8,981 feet long and 9,200 feet long including the approaches. The main span is 4,200 feet. The width of the bridge, including the two main towers and the road, is about 128 feet. So the road itself is 60 feet wide, divided into six lanes, each 12 feet wide. Wait, that doesn't add up because 6 lanes at 12 feet each would be 72 feet, plus shoulders. Maybe the total road width is 80 feet? Let me check: 6 lanes at 12 feet each is 72 feet, plus shoulders and maybe a median, so perhaps around 80 feet.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? If each is, say, 10 feet wide, then 13 of them would be 130 feet wide. But bridges have specific clearances and weight limits, so I wonder if 13 Mac Trucks side by side would even fit on the bridge. Wait, maybe I'm overestimating. Mac Trucks are big, but perhaps not 10 feet each. Let me think\u2014standard semi-trucks are about 8.5 feet wide, so maybe Mac Trucks are a bit wider, maybe 9 or 10 feet. So 13 times 9 is 117 feet. Now, the Golden Gate Bridge's width\u2014I think it's around 90 feet wide for the road, but that might be the total, including shoulders and maybe two lanes each way. If each lane is about 12 feet wide, and there are, say, four lanes in each direction, that's 48 feet. Plus shoulders and maybe some space for emergency vehicles. So maybe the total width is around 80-90 feet. If the 13 Mac Trucks take up 117 feet, that's wider than the bridge's road. So, they wouldn't fit side by side on the bridge. Therefore, they would likely jam up the bridge because they can't all fit at once. But wait, maybe the question is more about whether they can pass one after another, not all at the same time. But the question says \"side by side,\" so it's about fitting all 13 next to each other. So, yes, they would jam because the bridge isn't wide enough for 13 of them side by side.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen is 13 items.

They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge.

I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not sure of the exact width, but a standard semi-truck is about 8.5 feet wide. If each Mac Truck is similar, then 13 of them side by side would be 13 multiplied by 8.5, which is about 110.5 feet. Wait, that seems really wide. The Golden Gate Bridge's total width is about 90 feet, but that's including the two-way traffic lanes. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the total width with the deck width.

So, even if they were side by side, they wouldn't fit within the lanes. They would spill over, causing a blockage. Plus, the bridge's structure is designed for traffic moving in both directions, so having 13 trucks parked side by side would physically block the entire bridge, making it impossible for other vehicles to pass. Therefore, yes, a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks side by side would indeed jam up the Golden Gate Bridge.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen consists of 13 items. Mac Trucks are large vehicles, each approximately 8.5 feet wide. Calculating the total width: 13 trucks \u00d7 8.5 feet = 110.5 feet. The Golden Gate Bridge's deck is about 90 feet wide, with multiple lanes (each around 12 feet wide). The trucks' combined width (110.5 feet) exceeds the bridge's width and lane capacity, causing a blockage. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Well, traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge moves, so if 13 trucks were all trying to get on at once, it might cause a backup because there's a limited number of lanes. But the bridge is designed to handle a lot of traffic, so maybe it wouldn't get jammed. Alternatively, if all 13 trucks were on the bridge at the same time, would they block each other? If they're side by side, each in their own lane, then as long as there are enough lanes, they wouldn't block. But if there are only six lanes, and 13 trucks, that would mean multiple trucks per lane, which might cause congestion. But I'm not sure if the bridge allows trucks to be that close together or if traffic would just flow past them. Also, the Golden Gate Bridge has a height clearance, but that's about vertical space, not horizontal. So, considering all this, it seems that 13 Mac Trucks side by side, each about 9 feet wide, would take up 117 feet, which is less than the bridge's 128-foot width. So, they would fit without jamming up the bridge. However, traffic flow might be affected if there are too many trucks entering the bridge at the same time, causing a queue. But the question is about whether they would jam up the bridge, not necessarily about traffic flow. So, physically, they could fit without causing a blockage.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? Well, a standard semi-truck is about 8.5 feet wide, but Mac Trucks might be a bit wider because they're built for heavy loads. Let's say each is around 9 feet wide. So, 13 trucks at 9 feet each would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. Wait, but the bridge's total width is probably more than that. I think the Golden Gate Bridge is about 90 feet wide for the road, but that's probably for two-way traffic with maybe five lanes. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check: the Golden Gate Bridge has two main roadways, each with three lanes, I believe. So that's six lanes total. Each lane is typically around 12 feet wide, so six lanes would be 72 feet wide. But wait, that's the width of the road. The bridge itself is much wider because of the supports and the overall structure. I think the total width of the bridge, including the roadways and the side spans, is about 128 feet. So, 13 trucks at 9 feet each would take up 117 feet. Since the bridge is 128 feet wide, 117 feet is less than that. So, 13 trucks side by side would fit within the bridge's width. But wait, the question is about whether they would jam up the bridge. Even if they fit, if they're all lined up, would they cause a traffic jam?

I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? Well, a standard semi-truck trailer is about 8.5 feet wide. If a Mac Truck is similar or a bit larger, let's say around 9 feet wide. So, 13 of them side by side would be 13 times 9, which is 117 feet wide. Wait, that seems really wide. The Golden Gate Bridge's total width is around 90 feet for the traffic lanes, I believe. So, 117 feet is wider than that. That means if you line up 13 Mac Trucks side by side, they would actually be wider than the bridge itself. But wait, the bridge has multiple lanes. Let me check the exact number of lanes. I think it's six lanes total, three in each direction. So each lane is probably about 12 feet wide. Three lanes would be 36 feet, but maybe the lanes are wider. Let me see, actually, the Golden Gate Bridge has two main traffic decks, each with three lanes. So each deck is about 72 feet wide (3 lanes \u00d7 24 feet each, maybe). So 13 Mac Trucks at 9 feet each would take up 117 feet, which is wider than 72 feet. That suggests that 13 trucks side by side would not fit on one side of the bridge. But wait, the bridge is actually 90 feet wide in total, I think. Let me confirm: the main span is 4200 feet, but the width is about 90 feet for the road. So 13 trucks at 9 feet each would need 117 feet, which is more than 90 feet. That means they wouldn't fit side by side on the bridge. So, if you tried to put them all side by side, they would extend beyond the bridge's width, causing a jam because they can't all fit at the same time. Therefore, yes, a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks side by side would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge because their combined width exceeds the bridge's width.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen refers to 13 items. If each Mac Truck is about 9 feet wide, 13 trucks would occupy 117 feet. The Golden Gate Bridge is approximately 90 feet wide, which is narrower than the combined width of the trucks. Therefore, 13 Mac Trucks side by side would not fit on the bridge, causing a jam.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",
