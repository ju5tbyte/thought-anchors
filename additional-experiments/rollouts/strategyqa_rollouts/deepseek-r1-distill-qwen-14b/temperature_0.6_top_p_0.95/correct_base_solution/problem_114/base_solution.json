  "solution": "Okay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space.\n\nNext, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction.\n\nNow, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. That's a lot!\n\nBut wait, the Golden Gate Bridge isn't that wide. I think the total width, including the road and sidewalks, is about 90 feet or so. So if the bridge is only 90 feet wide and the trucks take up 117 feet, that's wider than the bridge itself. That means 13 trucks side by side wouldn't fit on the bridge at the same time. They would definitely cause a jam because there's no enough space for all of them to pass without blocking each other.\n\nAlso, considering traffic flow, even if they were spaced out, 13 such large vehicles would take up significant space and likely cause congestion. Plus, the bridge's design might not be intended to handle such a large number of wide vehicles simultaneously.\n\nSo, putting it all together, yes, a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would likely cause a jam on the Golden Gate Bridge because they exceed the bridge's width and would obstruct traffic flow.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen refers to 13 items. Mac Trucks are large, heavy-duty vehicles, each approximately 8-10 feet wide. Thirteen such trucks side by side would occupy about 117 feet in width. The Golden Gate Bridge, however, has a total width of around 90 feet, including all lanes and sidewalks. Since 117 feet exceeds the bridge's width, 13 trucks would not fit simultaneously, causing congestion and a jam.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",
