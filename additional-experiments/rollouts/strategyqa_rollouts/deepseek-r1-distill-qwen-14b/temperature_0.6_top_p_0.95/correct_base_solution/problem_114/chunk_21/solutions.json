    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. That's a lot! But wait, the Golden Gate Bridge isn't that wide. I think the total width, including the road and sidewalks, is about 90 feet or so. So if the bridge is only 90 feet wide and the trucks take up 117 feet, that's wider than the bridge itself. That means 13 trucks side by side wouldn't fit on the bridge at the same time. They would definitely cause a jam because there's no enough space for all of them to pass without blocking each other. Also, considering traffic flow, even if they were spaced out, 13 such large vehicles would take up significant space and likely cause congestion.",

So if the bridge is only 90 feet wide and the trucks take up 117 feet, that's wider than the bridge itself. That means 13 trucks side by side wouldn't fit on the bridge at the same time. They would definitely cause a jam because there's no enough space for all of them to pass without blocking each other. Also, considering traffic flow, even if they were spaced out, 13 such large vehicles would take up significant space and likely cause congestion.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. That's a lot! But wait, the Golden Gate Bridge isn't that wide. I think the total width, including the road and sidewalks, is about 90 feet or so. So if the bridge is only 90 feet wide and the trucks take up 117 feet, that's wider than the bridge itself. That means 13 trucks side by side wouldn't fit on the bridge at the same time. They would definitely cause a jam because there's no enough space for all of them to pass without blocking each other. Also, considering traffic flow, even if they were spaced out, 13 such large vehicles would take up significant space and likely cause congestion. So, putting it all together, yes, 13 Mac Trucks side by side would exceed the width of the Golden Gate Bridge, leading to a jam.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is approximately 90 feet wide, while a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks (13 trucks) at an average width of 9 feet each would span 117 feet.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. That's a lot! But wait, the Golden Gate Bridge isn't that wide. I think the total width, including the road and sidewalks, is about 90 feet or so. So if the bridge is only 90 feet wide and the trucks take up 117 feet, that's wider than the bridge itself. That means 13 trucks side by side wouldn't fit on the bridge at the same time. They would definitely cause a jam because there's no enough space for all of them to pass without blocking each other. Also, considering traffic flow, even if they were spaced out, 13 such large vehicles would take up significant space and likely cause congestion.

First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. That's a lot! But wait, the Golden Gate Bridge isn't that wide. I think the total width, including the road and sidewalks, is about 90 feet or so. So if the bridge is only 90 feet wide and the trucks take up 117 feet, that's wider than the bridge itself. That means 13 trucks side by side wouldn't fit on the bridge at the same time. They would definitely cause a jam because there's no enough space for all of them to pass without blocking each other.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. That's a lot! But wait, the Golden Gate Bridge isn't that wide. I think the total width, including the road and sidewalks, is about 90 feet or so. So if the bridge is only 90 feet wide and the trucks take up 117 feet, that's wider than the bridge itself. That means 13 trucks side by side wouldn't fit on the bridge at the same time. They would definitely cause a jam because there's no enough space for all of them to pass without blocking each other. Also, considering traffic flow, even if they were spaced out, 13 such large vehicles would take up significant space and likely cause congestion. So, putting it all together, yes, a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks side by side would indeed cause a jam on the Golden Gate Bridge.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is approximately 90 feet wide, while a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks (13 trucks) at an average width of 9 feet each would span 117 feet. Since 117 feet exceeds the bridge's width, the trucks would not fit side by side and would cause a jam.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. That's a lot! But wait, the Golden Gate Bridge isn't that wide. I think the total width, including the road and sidewalks, is about 90 feet or so. So if the bridge is only 90 feet wide and the trucks take up 117 feet, that's wider than the bridge itself. That means 13 trucks side by side wouldn't fit on the bridge at the same time. They would definitely cause a jam because there's no enough space for all of them to pass without blocking each other. Also, considering traffic flow, even if they were spaced out, 13 such large vehicles would take up significant space and likely cause congestion. So, putting it all together, yes, a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks side by side would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge because they collectively take up more width than the bridge itself.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen is 13 items, and Mac Trucks are large vehicles.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. That's a lot! But wait, the Golden Gate Bridge isn't that wide. I think the total width, including the road and sidewalks, is about 90 feet or so. So if the bridge is only 90 feet wide and the trucks take up 117 feet, that's wider than the bridge itself. That means 13 trucks side by side wouldn't fit on the bridge at the same time. They would definitely cause a jam because there's no enough space for all of them to pass without blocking each other. Also, considering traffic flow, even if they were spaced out, 13 such large vehicles would take up significant space and likely cause congestion.

First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. That's a lot! But wait, the Golden Gate Bridge isn't that wide. I think the total width, including the road and sidewalks, is about 90 feet or so. So if the bridge is only 90 feet wide and the trucks take up 117 feet, that's wider than the bridge itself. That means 13 trucks side by side wouldn't fit on the bridge at the same time. They would definitely cause a jam because there's no enough space for all of them to pass without blocking each other.

Also, considering traffic flow, even if they were spaced out, 13 such large vehicles would take up significant space and likely cause congestion. So, putting it all together, yes, a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks side by side would probably jam up the Golden Gate Bridge because they would exceed the bridge's width capacity.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen refers to 13 items. Mac Trucks are large vehicles, typically around 8 to 10 feet wide. Assuming an average width of 9 feet per truck, 13 trucks side by side would occupy 13 * 9 = 117 feet. The Golden Gate Bridge has a total width of approximately 90 feet, which is insufficient to accommodate 13 trucks simultaneously. This would result in congestion and blockage. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. That's a lot! But wait, the Golden Gate Bridge isn't that wide. I think the total width, including the road and sidewalks, is about 90 feet or so. So if the bridge is only 90 feet wide and the trucks take up 117 feet, that's wider than the bridge itself. That means 13 trucks side by side wouldn't fit on the bridge at the same time. They would definitely cause a jam because there's no enough space for all of them to pass without blocking each other. Also, considering traffic flow, even if they were spaced out, 13 such large vehicles would take up significant space and likely cause congestion.

Since 117 feet exceeds the bridge's width, 13 such trucks would not fit simultaneously, leading to congestion. Therefore, yes, a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks side by side would likely jam up the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. That's a lot! But wait, the Golden Gate Bridge isn't that wide. I think the total width, including the road and sidewalks, is about 90 feet or so. So if the bridge is only 90 feet wide and the trucks take up 117 feet, that's wider than the bridge itself. That means 13 trucks side by side wouldn't fit on the bridge at the same time. They would definitely cause a jam because there's no enough space for all of them to pass without blocking each other. Also, considering traffic flow, even if they were spaced out, 13 such large vehicles would take up significant space and likely cause congestion. So, putting it all together, yes, a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would indeed jam up the Golden Gate Bridge because their combined width exceeds the bridge's width, leading to a traffic backup.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen is 13 items. Mac Trucks are large, each approximately 9 feet wide. Thirteen such trucks would occupy 117 feet. The Golden Gate Bridge is about 90 feet wide, insufficient for 13 trucks side by side. This would cause congestion and a traffic backup.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. That's a lot! But wait, the Golden Gate Bridge isn't that wide. I think the total width, including the road and sidewalks, is about 90 feet or so. So if the bridge is only 90 feet wide and the trucks take up 117 feet, that's wider than the bridge itself. That means 13 trucks side by side wouldn't fit on the bridge at the same time. They would definitely cause a jam because there's no enough space for all of them to pass without blocking each other. Also, considering traffic flow, even if they were spaced out, 13 such large vehicles would take up significant space and likely cause congestion.",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. That's a lot! But wait, the Golden Gate Bridge isn't that wide. I think the total width, including the road and sidewalks, is about 90 feet or so. So if the bridge is only 90 feet wide and the trucks take up 117 feet, that's wider than the bridge itself. That means 13 trucks side by side wouldn't fit on the bridge at the same time. They would definitely cause a jam because there's no enough space for all of them to pass without blocking each other. Also, considering traffic flow, even if they were spaced out, 13 such large vehicles would take up significant space and likely cause congestion.",
