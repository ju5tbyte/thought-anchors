They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take?

I recall that the Golden Gate Bridge is 90 feet wide, with six lanes. So each lane is about 12 feet wide.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says \"side by side,\" so if they're all trying to fit across the bridge at the same time, that would be a problem. But in reality, traffic moves in lanes, so each truck would be in its own lane. The bridge has enough lanes to handle multiple trucks without them being side by side beyond the bridge's capacity. Also, the Golden Gate Bridge isn't just a single point; it's a long bridge. So, the question is whether 13 Mac Trucks, each 8 feet wide, would block the bridge. Since the bridge is 90 feet wide and has multiple lanes, 13 trucks would spread out across those lanes, and the bridge can handle that traffic flow. So, probably, they wouldn't jam up the bridge.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. That's a significant width. Now, the Golden Gate Bridge's roadway is probably wider than that, but I'm not certain. I think it's about 90 feet wide for the total, but I might be mixing it up with other bridges. Wait, actually, I think the Golden Gate Bridge has a total width of about 90 feet for traffic lanes, which includes maybe three lanes in each direction. If each lane is, say, 12 feet wide, then three lanes would be 36 feet. But that's just the traffic lanes, and there's also the median and maybe some shoulders. So, maybe the total width is wider than that. Let's say the bridge is 100 feet wide in total for traffic. If each Mac Truck is 9 feet wide, 13 of them would take up 117 feet, which is wider than the bridge's 100 feet. That suggests that 13 trucks side by side would not fit on the bridge. Alternatively, if the bridge is wider than 117 feet, then they might fit.

I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. Hmm, that's pretty wide. But wait, the Golden Gate Bridge isn't that wide. I think it's about 90 feet wide for the total road, with maybe 3 lanes each way. If each lane is about 12 feet wide, then three lanes would be 36 feet. But wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe each lane is wider. Let me think again. I've heard that the bridge has two main decks: the upper deck for cars and pedestrians, and the lower deck for trains and trucks. The upper deck has six lanes, I believe. So, if it's six lanes, each about 12 feet wide, that would be 72 feet wide. But if there are shoulders and barriers, maybe the actual road area is a bit less. So, if each lane is 12 feet and there are six lanes, that's 72 feet. But the trucks are 13, each taking 9 feet, totaling 117 feet. That's way more than 72 feet. Wait, that can't be right because the bridge's upper deck is 72 feet wide. So, 13 trucks at 9 feet each would require 117 feet, which is wider than the bridge itself. That means they wouldn't fit side by side on the bridge. Therefore, even if they tried to line up, they wouldn't all fit because the bridge isn't wide enough to accommodate all 13 side by side. So, the answer would be no, they wouldn't jam up the bridge because they physically can't all fit at the same time.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge's upper deck is 72 feet wide, with six lanes. Each Mac Truck is approximately 9 feet wide, so 13 trucks would require 117 feet, which exceeds the bridge's width. Therefore, they wouldn't fit side by side. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",

Now, the Golden Gate Bridge's deck is about 90 feet wide, I believe. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. I might be mixing it up with another bridge. Maybe the deck is wider. Let me check my memory. I think the total width including the sidewalks is about 120 feet. So, if the bridge is around 120 feet wide, and the trucks take up 117 feet, that's pretty close. But wait, the bridge has multiple lanes. Let's say each lane is about 12 feet wide, which is standard for a traffic lane. If there are six lanes in each direction, that's 6 * 12 = 72 feet. Plus, there are sidewalks and maybe some shoulders. So, maybe the total width is more than 100 feet. But 13 trucks at 9 feet each would take up 117 feet, which is more than the bridge's width. So, that would mean the trucks wouldn't fit side by side across the bridge. Therefore, they would indeed jam up the bridge because there's not enough width to fit all 13 trucks next to each other.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen is 13 items.

If each lane is, say, 12 feet wide, and there are, say, 8 lanes, the total width would be 96 feet. So 13 trucks at 9 feet each would take up 117 feet, which is wider than the bridge's total width. That doesn't make sense because the bridge can't be that narrow. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps each lane is 10 feet wide, and there are 6 lanes, totaling 60 feet. Then 13 trucks at 8 feet each would be 104 feet, which is still wider than the bridge. Hmm, this seems confusing. Maybe I should look up the actual width of the Golden Gate Bridge. From what I recall, the bridge is about 90 feet wide, with 6 traffic lanes. So each lane is about 15 feet wide. Wait, that might not be right. Actually, I think the bridge has two main decks: the upper deck for cars with 6 lanes and the lower deck for trains. The car deck is about 90 feet wide, with each lane being around 12 feet wide. So 6 lanes would be 6 * 12 = 72 feet. Now, 13 Mac Trucks at 12 feet each would be 13 * 12 = 156 feet. That's way wider than the bridge's 90 feet. So, if you tried to line up 13 of them side by side, they would definitely not fit on the bridge's car deck. But wait, the question is about whether they would \"jam up\" the bridge. Maybe it's not about fitting all 13 on the bridge at once, but whether having that many trucks trying to cross at the same time would cause a traffic jam. If 13 trucks were all trying to enter the bridge from the same direction, maybe the entrance could get blocked. But the bridge has multiple lanes, so maybe they can spread out. Alternatively, if all 13 were on the bridge at the same time, it would require the bridge to have enough lanes to accommodate them without stopping. Since the bridge is about 90 feet wide and each lane is 12 feet, 90 / 12 = 7.5 lanes. So, it can handle up to 7 lanes without overlapping. 13 trucks would require more than that, so they would have to take up multiple lanes, possibly causing a jam. But I'm not entirely sure.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. Wait, that seems really wide. I'm not sure if the bridge's lanes are that wide. Maybe I'm overestimating. Let me think again. If each lane is, say, 12 feet wide, and there are, say, 8 lanes, the total width would be 96 feet. So 13 trucks at 9 feet each would take up 117 feet, which is wider than the bridge's total width. That doesn't make sense because the bridge can't be that narrow. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps each lane is 10 feet wide, and there are 6 lanes, totaling 60 feet. Then 13 trucks at 8 feet each would be 104 feet, which is still wider than the bridge. Hmm, this seems confusing. Maybe I should look up the actual width of the Golden Gate Bridge. From what I recall, the bridge is about 90 feet wide, with 6 traffic lanes. So each lane is about 15 feet wide. Wait, that might not be right. Actually, I think the bridge has two main decks: the upper deck for cars with 6 lanes and the lower deck for trains. The car deck is about 90 feet wide, with each lane being around 12 feet wide. So 6 lanes would be 6 * 12 = 72 feet. Now, 13 Mac Trucks at 12 feet each would be 13 * 12 = 156 feet. That's way wider than the bridge's 90 feet. So, if you tried to line up 13 of them side by side, they would definitely not fit on the bridge's car deck. But wait, the question is about whether they would \"jam up\" the bridge. Maybe it's not about fitting all 13 on the bridge at once, but whether having that many trucks trying to cross at the same time would cause a traffic jam. If 13 trucks were all trying to enter the bridge from the same direction, maybe the entrance could get blocked. But the bridge has multiple lanes, so maybe they can spread out. Alternatively, if all 13 were on the bridge at the same time, it would require the bridge to have enough lanes to accommodate them without stopping. Since the bridge is about 90 feet wide and each lane is 12 feet, 90 / 12 = 7.5 lanes. So, it can handle up to 7 lanes without overlapping. 13 trucks would require more than that, so they would have to take up multiple lanes, possibly causing a jam. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's more about the physical space than the number of trucks. If each truck is 12 feet wide, 13 would take up 156 feet, which is way more than the bridge's 90 feet.

So, 117 feet is wider than the bridge's road. That would mean that 13 Mac Trucks side by side would definitely not fit on the bridge because the bridge isn't that wide. But maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check the actual width. The Golden Gate Bridge has a main span of 4200 feet, but the deck width is about 90 feet, including six traffic lanes. Each traffic lane is typically 12 feet wide, so six lanes would be 72 feet. Adding shoulders and sidewalks, it totals around 90 feet. So, each lane is 12 feet, and if a Mac Truck is about 8.5 feet wide, then in one lane, you could fit maybe one truck with some space left. But if you have 13 trucks, even if they were in multiple lanes, the bridge's total width is 90 feet. 13 trucks at 8.5 feet each would be 13 * 8.5 = 110.5 feet. That's still wider than the bridge's 90 feet. So, they wouldn't fit side by side across the entire bridge. Therefore, yes, a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks would likely cause a jam because they wouldn't fit within the bridge's width.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge's deck is approximately 90 feet wide, including six traffic lanes.

Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. That seems really wide. The Golden Gate Bridge, on the other hand, I believe is about 90 feet wide for the road. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 13 trucks at 9 feet each would be way wider than the bridge itself. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check again. If each lane is about 12 feet wide, and there are, say, 8 lanes total, that's 96 feet. But that's the total width. If 13 trucks are placed side by side, each taking up maybe 8.5 feet, that would be 13 * 8.5 = 110.5 feet. That's wider than the bridge's 96 feet. So, that would mean the trucks wouldn't fit side by side across the bridge's width. But wait, maybe the bridge's deck is wider. Alternatively, perhaps the bridge has a clearance that's higher, but the question is about fitting side by side, so it's about the width. If the bridge's road is 90 feet wide and the trucks take up 117 feet when lined up, that's impossible. So, 13 Mac Trucks side by side would indeed jam up the Golden Gate Bridge because they wouldn't fit within the bridge's width. Therefore, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen consists of 13 items. Mac Trucks are large vehicles, each approximately 8.5 feet wide.

Perhaps 11 feet per lane? 8 lanes would then be 88 feet, which is close to the 90 feet total. So, 8 lanes at 11 feet each make 88 feet, leaving some space for shoulders or medians. So, if the bridge is 90 feet wide, and each lane is 11 feet, 13 trucks at 9 feet each would be 117 feet, which is wider than 90 feet. That means they wouldn't all fit side by side on the bridge. Therefore, having 13 Mac Trucks side by side would likely cause a jam because they wouldn't fit within the bridge's width. They'd either need to go one after the other or take up more space than available.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge has a road deck width of approximately 90 feet, with 8 lanes (about 11 feet each), totaling around 88 feet. A baker's dozen of 13 Mac Trucks, each about 9 feet wide, would require 117 feet of space side by side, exceeding the bridge's width. Therefore, they would not fit and would likely cause a jam.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take?

Wait, but the bridge's total width is more than that because it includes shoulders and maybe other structures. Maybe the total width is around 134 feet, including all lanes and barriers. So, if the bridge is about 134 feet wide and the 13 trucks take up 110.5 feet, that leaves about 23.5 feet of space. That seems like it might be tight, but not necessarily causing a jam.

That seems really wide. Now, how wide is the Golden Gate Bridge? I looked it up before, and I think the bridge's total width, including the road and sidewalks, is about 90 feet. Wait, is that right? Maybe I'm confusing it with another bridge. I think the main span is 4200 feet, but the width of the road is what matters here. Let me think again. I think the bridge has six traffic lanes, each about 12 feet wide, plus sidewalks. So, 6 lanes * 12 feet = 72 feet for the traffic lanes, plus maybe 10 feet for sidewalks, totaling around 82 feet. So, the bridge's road is about 82 feet wide. Now, if each Mac Truck is 9 feet wide, 13 trucks would take up 117 feet. But the bridge's road is only 82 feet wide. That means 13 trucks side by side would require more width than the bridge actually has. Therefore, they wouldn't fit side by side on the bridge. So, the answer would be no, they wouldn't jam up the bridge because they wouldn't all fit at once.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen refers to 13 items.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. Wait, that seems really wide. The Golden Gate Bridge's road is probably not that wide. I think the total width, including the two main traffic lanes and the median, is about 70 feet. So, 117 feet is more than the total width of the bridge. That means even if all 13 trucks were lined up, they wouldn't fit side by side on the bridge. Therefore, it's impossible for them to jam up the bridge because they can't all fit at once. Also, the bridge's traffic is managed in lanes, so each truck would be in its own lane, and having 13 of them would require more lanes than the bridge has. So, in conclusion, 13 Mac Trucks side by side can't fit on the Golden Gate Bridge, so they wouldn't cause a jam.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen refers to 13 items, so we're considering 13 Mac Trucks placed side by side. Mac Trucks are large vehicles, typically around 8-10 feet wide. Assuming an average width of 9 feet per truck, 13 trucks would span 13 * 9 = 117 feet. The Golden Gate Bridge's roadway is approximately 70 feet wide, which is narrower than the combined width of the 13 trucks. Therefore, it's impossible for all 13 trucks to fit side by side on the bridge, making it impossible for them to jam up the bridge.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

If each lane is 12 feet, and there are, say, six lanes in one direction, the total width for those lanes would be 6 * 12 = 72 feet. But if the trucks are taking up 117 feet, that's way more than the bridge's width. That doesn't make sense because the bridge can't have lanes wider than that. Maybe I miscalculated. Perhaps the trucks are not as wide as I thought. Let me check again. If each truck is 8 feet wide, 13 trucks would be 13 * 8 = 104 feet. That's still wider than the bridge's lanes. Alternatively, maybe the bridge's total width is wider than the lanes. I think the Golden Gate Bridge is about 90 feet wide for the road, which has six lanes. So 90 feet divided by six lanes would be 15 feet per lane. Wait, that doesn't add up because 6 lanes at 15 feet each would be 90 feet. So each lane is 15 feet wide. If each Mac Truck is, say, 8 feet wide, then 13 trucks would take up 13 * 8 = 104 feet. That's more than the bridge's total road width of 90 feet. So, even if they were all lined up, they wouldn't fit side by side on the bridge. Therefore, they would definitely jam up the bridge because their combined width exceeds the bridge's width. But wait, the bridge has multiple lanes, so maybe they can drive in different lanes. But 13 trucks in separate lanes would require more lanes than the bridge has. The Golden Gate Bridge has six lanes, so 13 trucks would need more than two lanes each, which isn't possible. So, yes, a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks side by side would likely cause a jam because their total width exceeds the bridge's capacity.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is 90 feet wide, accommodating six lanes.

So, 117 feet is less than 128 feet, which suggests that 13 trucks could fit side by side without exceeding the bridge's width. But wait, I'm not sure if the bridge's total width is exactly 128 feet. Maybe it's wider. I should double-check that. Let me think; the Golden Gate Bridge has two main travel lanes in each direction, plus walkways. Each lane is probably around 12 feet wide. So, four lanes would be 48 feet, plus the walkways and the central median. Maybe the total width is around 128 feet. If that's the case, then 117 feet is within that limit. However, I should also consider the clearance and the actual structure. The bridge has a certain height and vertical clearance, but since we're talking about width, I think the horizontal space is the main concern here.

I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide.

I think the main span is about 4200 feet long, but the total width including the two side spans is wider. However, the actual deck width for vehicles is probably around 80-90 feet. So if the bridge's vehicle deck is about 90 feet wide, and the 13 trucks take up 117 feet, that's more than the bridge's width. That would mean they wouldn't fit side by side on the bridge. But wait, maybe the bridge has multiple lanes, so each lane is about 12 feet wide. If there are, say, six lanes, that's 72 feet. But 13 trucks at 9 feet each would still need 117 feet, which is wider than the 72 feet of the lanes combined. So, they wouldn't fit all in one direction. But the question is about jamming up the bridge. If you have 13 trucks trying to go side by side, even if the bridge is wide enough, traffic might get backed up because it's an unusual and possibly unsafe configuration. However, the main issue is the physical space. If the bridge's lanes are each 12 feet wide and there are six lanes, the total width is 72 feet. Thirteen trucks at 9 feet each would require 117 feet, which is wider than 72 feet. So, they physically can't all fit side by side on the bridge. Therefore, they would jam up the bridge because they can't all fit at once. But wait, maybe the bridge's total width is more than 90 feet? Let me think again. The Golden Gate Bridge has two main traffic decks, one for each direction. Each deck is about 80 feet wide, divided into multiple lanes. So, if each deck is 80 feet wide, and each lane is 12 feet, that's about 6 or 7 lanes per deck. So, 13 trucks at 9 feet each would need 117 feet, which is more than 80 feet. So, even if they tried to go across side by side, they wouldn't fit on the bridge's deck. Therefore, they would cause a jam because they can't all be on the bridge at the same time. Alternatively, maybe the question is more about whether 13 trucks would cause a traffic backup, regardless of fitting. If they tried to enter the bridge one after another, they might cause a queue, but the question is about being side by side. So, in that case, they wouldn't fit, leading to a jam because they can't all be on the bridge simultaneously.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. Wait, that seems really wide. The Golden Gate Bridge's total width is something like 90 feet or so, maybe a bit more. Let me double-check that. I think the main span is about 4200 feet long, but the total width including the two side spans is wider. However, the actual deck width for vehicles is probably around 80-90 feet. So if the bridge's vehicle deck is about 90 feet wide, and the 13 trucks take up 117 feet, that's more than the bridge's width. That would mean they wouldn't fit side by side on the bridge. But wait, maybe the bridge has multiple lanes, so each lane is about 12 feet wide. If there are, say, six lanes, that's 72 feet. But 13 trucks at 9 feet each would still need 117 feet, which is wider than the 72 feet of the lanes combined. So, they wouldn't fit all in one direction. But the question is about jamming up the bridge. If you have 13 trucks trying to go side by side, even if the bridge is wide enough, traffic might get backed up because it's an unusual and possibly unsafe configuration. However, the main issue is the physical space. If the bridge's lanes are each 12 feet wide and there are six lanes, the total width is 72 feet. Thirteen trucks at 9 feet each would require 117 feet, which is wider than 72 feet. So, they physically can't all fit side by side on the bridge. Therefore, they would jam up the bridge because they can't all fit at once. But wait, maybe the bridge's total width is more than 90 feet? Let me think again. The Golden Gate Bridge has two main traffic decks, one for each direction. Each deck is about 80 feet wide, divided into multiple lanes. So, if each deck is 80 feet wide, and each lane is 12 feet, that's about 6 or 7 lanes per deck. So, 13 trucks at 9 feet each would need 117 feet, which is more than 80 feet. So, even if they tried to go across side by side, they wouldn't fit on the bridge's deck. Therefore, they would cause a jam because they can't all be on the bridge at the same time. Alternatively, maybe the question is more about whether 13 trucks would cause a traffic backup, regardless of fitting. If they tried to enter the bridge one after another, they might cause a queue, but the question is about being side by side. So, in that case, they wouldn't fit, leading to a jam because they can't all be on the bridge simultaneously. So, the answer is yes, they would jam up the bridge because they can't all fit side by side.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge's traffic deck is approximately 80 feet wide, divided into multiple lanes.

The Golden Gate Bridge has two main traffic lanes, each with multiple lanes. I think each direction has five lanes, so total of 10 lanes.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. Wait, that seems really wide. The Golden Gate Bridge's roadway is about 90 feet wide, if I recall correctly. So 117 feet is wider than the bridge's total width. That means even if the trucks were perfectly aligned, they wouldn't fit side by side on the bridge because the bridge isn't wide enough to accommodate 13 of them at once. So, if all 13 Mac Trucks tried to go across the bridge at the same time side by side, they wouldn't fit, which would likely cause a traffic jam or block the bridge entirely. Therefore, the answer should be yes, they would jam up the bridge.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is approximately 90 feet wide, while 13 Mac Trucks side by side would span about 117 feet.

But wait, maybe the trucks are not all taking up the entire width of each lane. Or perhaps the bridge has shoulders or other areas where they could fit. Alternatively, maybe the bridge's actual total width is larger than I thought. Let me think again. The Golden Gate Bridge's main span is about 4200 feet long, but the total width, including all the lanes, is around 100 feet. So, 13 trucks at 8.5 feet each would be over 100 feet, which is more than the bridge's width. That would mean they wouldn't fit side by side across the bridge. Therefore, trying to line them up that way would cause a jam because they wouldn't all fit at once. Alternatively, maybe the question is more about traffic flow. If 13 trucks were trying to cross the bridge at the same time, would they cause a backup? But the bridge can handle multiple lanes of traffic, so unless there's an obstruction, they might not necessarily jam up the bridge. But the question specifically mentions side by side, which suggests they're lined up in a single line across the bridge's width. If the bridge's lanes are each 12 feet wide, and 13 trucks at 8.5 feet each would require more than 100 feet, which is more than the bridge's total width, that's impossible.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, how much space does each Mac Truck take? I'm not entirely sure, but I know that large trucks are usually around 8 to 10 feet wide. If I take an average of 9 feet per truck, then 13 trucks side by side would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. Wait, that seems really wide. The Golden Gate Bridge's total width, including the road and all, is something like 90 feet or so. Hmm, that can't be right because 117 feet is wider than the bridge itself. Maybe I'm overestimating the space each truck takes. Perhaps each lane is about 12 feet wide, and a truck might take up a bit less than that. Let me check\u2014standard truck width is about 8.5 feet. So 13 trucks would be 13 * 8.5 = 110.5 feet.
