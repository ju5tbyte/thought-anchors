    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So, each lane is probably about 12 feet wide or something similar.",
    "rollout": " So, each lane is probably about 12 feet wide or something similar. Let me check that. Yeah, standard highway lanes are around 12 feet wide. So, if each lane is 12 feet, and there are, say, eight lanes total (four in each direction), that would give a total width of 8 times 12, which is 96 feet. Wait, no, that's if they're all side by side. But actually, the bridge might have a certain number of lanes. Let me think. I think the Golden Gate Bridge has six lanes total, three in each direction. So, each direction has three lanes. So, each lane is about 12 feet, so three lanes would be 36 feet wide per direction. So, the total width of the bridge from one side to the other would be 36 feet for one direction and another 36 feet for the other, but that's not quite right because the bridge isn't two separate bridges; it's a single structure with multiple lanes. Actually, the total width is the sum of all lanes plus any barriers or shoulders. Let me look up the actual width. Oh wait, I can't actually look things up right now, but I recall that the Golden Gate Bridge is about 90 feet wide overall, with six lanes. So, each lane is 12 feet, and six lanes would take up 72 feet, leaving some space for barriers or shoulders. So, maybe the total width is around 90 feet.\n\nNow, each Mac Truck is pretty big. Let me estimate their width. A standard semi-truck trailer is about 8.5 feet wide, but a Mac Truck is a bit wider because it's a heavy-duty truck with a larger cab. Maybe around 9-10 feet wide each. So, if each Mac Truck is 9 feet wide, 13 of them side by side would take up 13 * 9 = 117 feet. Wait, that's more than the bridge's total width of about 90 feet. So, 117 feet is wider than 90 feet. That means that 13 Mac Trucks side by side would not fit on the bridge because they would require more width than the bridge provides.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me double-check. If the bridge is 90 feet wide and has six lanes, each lane is 12 feet, so 6 * 12 = 72 feet. That leaves about 18 feet for barriers and shoulders. So, the actual usable width for vehicles is 72 feet. If each Mac Truck is 9 feet wide, 13 trucks would take up 117 feet, which is way more than 72 feet. So, it's impossible to fit 13 of them side by side on the bridge.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Mac Trucks are not as wide as I'm thinking. Perhaps they're more like 8 feet each. Then, 13 * 8 = 104 feet, which is still more than 72 feet. So, even if they're 8 feet wide, 13 of them would still not fit.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the question is about whether they would cause a traffic jam rather than physically not fitting. But if they can't physically fit side by side, then they can't all be on the bridge at the same time, which would definitely cause a jam because they'd have to queue up. However, the question seems to be about whether they would physically fit, causing a blockage. So, given that the bridge is only about 90 feet wide and 13 trucks at 9 feet each would take up 117 feet, they wouldn't fit, leading to a jam as they try to enter the bridge but can't all be on it simultaneously.\n\nWait, but maybe the bridge's total width is more than I thought. Let me think again. I've heard that the Golden Gate Bridge is about 1.7 miles long and 90 feet wide. So, 90 feet is the total width. So, 13 trucks at 9 feet each would take up 117 feet, which is more than 90. Therefore, they can't all fit side by side on the bridge.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that yes, a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks side by side would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge because they would require more width than the bridge offers, causing a traffic block.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is approximately 90 feet wide, with six lanes totaling around 72 feet of usable width for vehicles. A baker's dozen of Mac Trucks, each about 9 feet wide, would require 117 feet of space side by side, exceeding the bridge's width.

Maybe the Golden Gate Bridge has fewer lanes. Let me check my facts. Oh, actually, the Golden Gate Bridge has six lanes in total, three in each direction.

Let's assume the bridge is wide enough for multiple lanes, but how does that compare to the width of 13 Mac Trucks?

So, 117 feet is less than 120 feet, so they might just barely fit. But wait, that doesn't account for the structure of the bridge. The bridge has a lot of supports and maybe the clearance is an issue. Also, the height of the trucks might be a problem if the bridge's clearance is low. But I think the Golden Gate Bridge has a high clearance because it's a suspension bridge. So, maybe the height isn't an issue, but the width is. If 13 trucks take up 117 feet and the bridge is 120 feet wide, they might fit with a little space left. But in reality, bridges have shoulders and other structures, so maybe the actual usable width is less. Also, the trucks can't be placed exactly edge to edge because there needs to be some space between them for safety and movement. So, maybe the 13 trucks would take up more space than available, causing a jam. Alternatively, if the bridge is wider, maybe it can accommodate them.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge.

Maybe each deck has four lanes? So in total, eight lanes. That would be four lanes each way. Now, how wide are Mac Trucks? I think a standard Mac Truck, like a refuse truck, is pretty wide. Maybe around 9 to 10 feet wide? So if each truck is about 10 feet wide, 13 of them side by side would be 130 feet wide. But wait, that seems too much because the bridge can't be that wide. Maybe I'm overestimating the truck width. Let me think again. A typical semi-truck trailer is about 8.5 feet wide, so maybe a Mac Truck is similar or slightly wider. Let's say 9 feet each. So 13 trucks would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet. Now, the Golden Gate Bridge's deck width... I think each deck is about 84 feet wide. So if each deck is 84 feet, and there are two decks, that's 168 feet total. But wait, that's the total width, including all lanes and maybe shoulders. So each deck has multiple lanes. If each deck is 84 feet wide, and let's say each lane is about 12 feet wide, then 84 / 12 = 7 lanes per deck. That doesn't sound right because I thought there were fewer lanes. Maybe the lanes are wider, including shoulders or barriers. Alternatively, perhaps each lane is 10 feet wide. So 84 / 10 = 8.4 lanes, which doesn't make sense. Maybe the lanes are 11 feet wide. 84 / 11 \u2248 7.6, so around 7 lanes per deck. But that seems too many. I think the Golden Gate Bridge has four lanes in total, two in each direction.

If 13 Mac Trucks were to go side by side, that's a very tight formation. But in reality, traffic doesn't move like that; vehicles are spread out. Also, the bridge's lanes are designed for normal vehicles, not for 13 trucks to occupy the entire width.

Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Let me check that\u2014yes, I believe it's six lanes total, three in each direction. So each lane is probably about 12 feet wide, which is standard for highways. If each lane is 12 feet, three lanes would be 36 feet wide in one direction. Now, how wide is a Mac Truck? Mac Trucks are heavy-duty, so they're quite wide. Let me think, maybe around 8-9 feet per truck? So 13 of them side by side would be 13 times 8 feet, which is about 104 feet. Wait, that seems too wide. That can't be right because the bridge's lanes are only 12 feet each. Oh, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. If each lane is 12 feet, and the bridge has three lanes in each direction, the total width for one direction is 36 feet. If I have 13 Mac Trucks, each taking up, say, 9 feet, that would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet. But the bridge's lane is only 12 feet wide, so even one Mac Truck would take up almost the entire lane. So, 13 of them side by side would require a much wider space than the bridge provides. Therefore, they wouldn't fit side by side on the Golden Gate Bridge. So, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge has a total width of 98 feet, with three lanes in each direction. Each lane is 12 feet wide. A baker's dozen is 13, so 13 Mac Trucks, each approximately 9 feet wide, would require 117 feet of space side by side. Since the bridge's lanes are only 12 feet wide, the trucks would not fit side by side. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",

Wait, that can't be right because 130 feet is wider than that. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me check my facts.

Or maybe the upper deck has seven lanes and the lower deck has three? I'm a bit confused, but I think the total number is around eight lanes for cars, plus maybe some for buses or emergency vehicles. Anyway, each lane is about 12 feet wide, I believe. So if there are eight lanes, each 12 feet wide, that's 96 feet wide. But wait, the bridge also has shoulders and maybe some barriers between lanes. So the total width might be a bit more. Let's say approximately 100 feet wide. Now, each Mac Truck is a large vehicle. Let me think about their width. A standard semi-truck trailer is about 8.5 feet wide, but Mac Trucks are bigger. Maybe around 10 feet wide each? So 13 of them side by side would be 13 * 10 = 130 feet wide. Wait, that seems way wider than the bridge. If the bridge is 100 feet wide and the trucks are 130 feet wide, that would mean they wouldn't fit side by side across the bridge.

So two decks would make it 200 feet wide. Wait, no, the decks are stacked, so the total width isn't doubled like that. It's more about the width of each deck. So if each deck is 75 feet wide, with multiple lanes, maybe the total width is around 75 feet. So 13 Mac Trucks at 10 feet each would be 130 feet, which is way more than 75 feet. So they wouldn't fit. But wait, maybe the bridge has more width because of the barriers and shoulders. Let's say each lane is 12 feet, plus 2 feet for shoulders on each side. So each lane plus shoulder is 14 feet. If there are six lanes, that's 6 * 14 = 84 feet. Plus maybe some more for the barriers. So maybe the total width is around 90 feet. 13 trucks at 10 feet each would be 130 feet, which is still wider. So, they wouldn't fit. Therefore, a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks side by side would indeed jam up the Golden Gate Bridge because they take up more width than the bridge provides.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is approximately 90 feet wide, considering lane widths and shoulders.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Let me check that in my mind\u2014Golden Gate Bridge has two main decks, each with seven standard lanes. Wait, no, I think it's actually two decks: the upper deck has six lanes, and the lower deck has two lanes for cars. So total of eight lanes? Or maybe the upper deck has seven lanes and the lower deck has three? I'm a bit confused, but I think the total number is around eight lanes for cars, plus maybe some for buses or emergency vehicles. Anyway, each lane is about 12 feet wide, I believe. So if there are eight lanes, each 12 feet wide, that's 96 feet wide. But wait, the bridge also has shoulders and maybe some barriers between lanes. So the total width might be a bit more. Let's say approximately 100 feet wide. Now, each Mac Truck is a large vehicle. Let me think about their width. A standard semi-truck trailer is about 8.5 feet wide, but Mac Trucks are bigger. Maybe around 10 feet wide each? So 13 of them side by side would be 13 * 10 = 130 feet wide. Wait, that seems way wider than the bridge. If the bridge is 100 feet wide and the trucks are 130 feet wide, that would mean they wouldn't fit side by side across the bridge. But wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. Each lane is 12 feet wide, and there are eight lanes, so 12 * 8 = 96 feet. If each Mac Truck is 10 feet wide, 13 trucks would take up 130 feet. That's wider than the bridge's 96 feet. So that would mean they wouldn't fit. But maybe the bridge is wider than I thought. I think I might be underestimating the bridge's width. Let me recall, the Golden Gate Bridge is about 8,000 feet long, but that's the length. The width is across the road deck. Maybe each deck is about 100 feet wide. So two decks would make it 200 feet wide. Wait, no, the decks are stacked, so the total width isn't doubled like that. It's more about the width of each deck.

So they wouldn't fit. But wait, maybe the bridge has more width because of the barriers and shoulders. Let's say each lane is 12 feet, plus 2 feet for shoulders on each side. So each lane plus shoulder is 14 feet. If there are six lanes, that's 6 * 14 = 84 feet. Plus maybe some more for the barriers. So maybe the total width is around 90 feet. 13 trucks at 10 feet each would be 130 feet, which is still wider. So, they wouldn't fit. Therefore, a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks side by side would indeed jam up the Golden Gate Bridge because they take up more width than the bridge provides.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is approximately 90 feet wide, considering lane widths and shoulders.

I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, if each Mac Truck is, say, about 8 feet wide (I'm not entirely sure, but that's a common width for large trucks), then 13 of them side by side would be 13 times 8, which is 104 feet. That seems really wide. But wait, bridges usually have a certain clearance and structure. The Golden Gate Bridge is about 8,000 feet long, but the actual width for traffic is probably around 100 feet or so. If 13 trucks take up 104 feet, that's just a bit more than the bridge's traffic width. But maybe the bridge is wider than that. Alternatively, perhaps the trucks are narrower. I might be overestimating their width. Also, the Golden Gate Bridge has two main spans and is quite wide to handle the traffic flow. I think it's designed to handle multiple lanes of vehicles, so maybe 13 trucks wouldn't cause a jam because the bridge is built to handle such widths. Plus, traffic on the bridge moves, so unless all 13 trucks are stopping at the same spot, which is unlikely, they wouldn't block the bridge. So, considering all this, I don't think 13 Mac Trucks side by side would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge because the bridge is wide enough to accommodate that.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is wide enough to handle multiple lanes of traffic, including large vehicles like Mac Trucks. A baker's dozen (13) of these trucks, each approximately 8 feet wide, would span about 104 feet. Given the bridge's design for handling such widths, 13 trucks side by side are unlikely to cause a jam. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

I'm a bit confused about the exact dimensions, but I think the key point is that a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks would take up a significant width, potentially exceeding the bridge's capacity, leading to a jam.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge has a total width of approximately 80 feet, with four lanes in each direction, each lane being about 12 feet wide. A baker's dozen consists of 13 Mac Trucks, each roughly 8 feet wide. Placing 13 trucks side by side would require 104 feet of space, exceeding the bridge's width. Even considering multiple lanes, the trucks cannot all fit without causing congestion. Therefore, they would likely jam up the bridge.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

But 13 of them side by side would require a lot of space. Let me think about the actual width of the bridge. The Golden Gate Bridge is about 1,280 meters long, but its total width, including all lanes and walkways, is something like 61 meters. If each lane is, say, 3.5 meters wide, and there are, let's say, 10 lanes total (maybe 5 in each direction), that's 5 lanes wide. So each lane is 3.5 meters, so 5 lanes would be 17.5 meters wide.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Now, each lane is probably wide enough for a standard car, but Mac Trucks are much wider than regular cars. They have those big cabins and long cargo areas. So, if I imagine one Mac Truck in a lane, it might take up more than one lane's width. Wait, no, each lane is designed for vehicles, so maybe a truck would fit within a lane. But 13 of them side by side would require a lot of space. Let me think about the actual width of the bridge. The Golden Gate Bridge is about 1,280 meters long, but its total width, including all lanes and walkways, is something like 61 meters. If each lane is, say, 3.5 meters wide, and there are, let's say, 10 lanes total (maybe 5 in each direction), that's 5 lanes wide. So each lane is 3.5 meters, so 5 lanes would be 17.5 meters wide. But wait, that's just the main part. There are also shoulders and walkways, so the total width is wider. But even if I take the main lanes as 17.5 meters, can 13 Mac Trucks fit side by side in that? Each Mac Truck is probably at least 3 meters wide, maybe more. Let's say each is 3.5 meters. So 13 trucks would take up 13 * 3.5 = 45.5 meters. But the bridge's main span is only about 61 meters wide, so maybe there's enough space? Wait, no, because the bridge's width includes all lanes plus other areas. Maybe the actual space available for vehicles isn't 61 meters but less. Also, the Golden Gate Bridge has a single deck with two levels: the upper level has six lanes (three in each direction), and the lower level has two lanes and a walkway. So the upper level is wider. If we're considering the upper level, which has six lanes, each lane is about 3.5 meters, so 6 lanes would be 21 meters. But 13 trucks at 3.5 meters each would need 45.5 meters, which is way more than the 21 meters available. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps each lane is wider.

So 13 would definitely cause a jam. \n\nBut wait, maybe the question is about whether they would physically fit, not about the number of lanes. If the bridge's total width is 90 feet, and 13 trucks at 9 feet each would take up 117 feet, which is more than 90, so they can't fit side by side. Therefore, they would cause a jam because they wouldn't fit without overlapping. \n\nSo, the answer is yes, a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge because they wouldn't fit side by side within the bridge's width.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if a baker's dozen (13) of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge, we need to compare the total width of the trucks to the bridge's width. \n\n1. **Golden Gate Bridge Dimensions**: The bridge is 90 feet wide, including six traffic lanes (three in each direction) and two walkways. Each traffic lane is approximately 12 feet wide.\n\n2. **Mac Trucks Dimensions**: Each Mac Truck is roughly 9 feet wide.\n\n3. **Calculating the Total Width of 13 Trucks**: \n   - 13 trucks \u00d7 9 feet = 117 feet.\n\n4. **Comparison**: The bridge's total width is 90 feet, which is less than the 117 feet required for 13 trucks side by side. This means the trucks would not fit without overlapping, causing a jam.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Alternatively, perhaps the bridge's total width is 90 feet, which includes all the lanes and the supports. So, if the road part is 80 feet wide, with multiple lanes, and each Mac Truck is 10 feet wide, 13 trucks would need 130 feet, which is way beyond the 80 feet available. That would definitely cause a jam. So, the answer should be yes, they would jam up the bridge.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen consists of 13 items. Mac Trucks are large vehicles, each approximately 10 feet wide. The Golden Gate Bridge has a total width of about 90 feet, with the road portion being around 80 feet wide, accommodating multiple lanes. If each lane is 12 feet wide, 13 Mac Trucks side by side would require 130 feet, exceeding the bridge's available width. Therefore, they would indeed cause a jam.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

So, 13 Mac Trucks at 9 feet each would be 117 feet, which is wider than 96 feet. Therefore, they wouldn't fit side by side on the bridge. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the bridge is wider than that. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the trucks are placed in a single lane, but 13 of them would just be a long line, not necessarily causing a jam unless they're all trying to go at the same time. But the question is about being side by side, so across the width of the bridge. If the bridge is 90 feet wide and each truck is 9 feet, 13 would be 117 feet, which is wider. So, they wouldn't fit, causing a jam. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact measurements, so I might be off. However, based on this reasoning, I think the answer is yes, they would jam up the bridge.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is 90 feet wide, while 13 Mac Trucks placed side by side would span 117 feet, exceeding the bridge's width.

If 13 Mac Trucks are placed side by side, how much width would that take? Let's assume each Mac Truck is about 9 feet wide, which is typical for a large truck. So 13 trucks would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet wide. The Golden Gate Bridge is about 90 feet wide for the road, but wait, no, that's the total width including sidewalks. The actual road is narrower. Let me think, the bridge has two main roadways, each with three lanes. So each lane is about 12 feet wide, so three lanes would be 36 feet. But that seems too narrow for 13 trucks. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up numbers. \n\nWait, I should look up the actual width of the Golden Gate Bridge's road. From what I recall, the total width of the bridge's deck is about 90 feet, with 62 feet allocated for the two roadways (31 feet each) and 10 feet for sidewalks on each side. So each roadway is about 31 feet wide, which includes three lanes. So each lane is roughly 10-11 feet wide. If each lane is 11 feet, three lanes would be 33 feet. But that doesn't add up because 31 feet for three lanes would be around 10.3 feet per lane. So each lane is about 10-11 feet wide.\n\nNow, if a Mac Truck is about 9 feet wide, placing 13 of them side by side would require 13 * 9 = 117 feet. But the bridge's road is only about 31 feet wide per direction. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, the 13 trucks are placed side by side along the length of the bridge, not across the width. So each truck is parked end to end, not side by side across the lanes. So the question is about 13 trucks lined up next to each other along the bridge's length, not across the width. That changes things.\n\nSo, if each Mac Truck is about 20 feet long, 13 of them would be 260 feet long. The Golden Gate Bridge's main span is about 4200 feet long, so 260 feet is a small portion. But wait, the question is about jamming up the bridge, which could mean blocking traffic. If 13 trucks are parked side by side, perhaps in one lane, they would take up a significant length, causing a backlog of traffic behind them. But the bridge has multiple lanes, so unless all lanes are filled with such a line of trucks, it might not cause a complete jam. However, if all six lanes were filled with 13 trucks each, that would be a lot, but the question specifies a baker's dozen (13) in side by side, which I think refers to a single line of 13 trucks in one lane.\n\nSo, in that case, 13 trucks in one lane would take up 260 feet, which is a considerable length, but the bridge is much longer, so it might not block the entire bridge but could cause a significant delay in that lane. However, the Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge with a lot of traffic, so even a single lane being blocked could cause congestion. But would it \"jam up\" the entire bridge? Probably not, because the other lanes would still be open. Unless all lanes are blocked, which the question doesn't specify.\n\nWait, the question says a baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks. So maybe it's 13 trucks in each lane, but that seems unlikely because a baker's dozen is 13, not per lane. Alternatively, 13 trucks across all lanes.

However, if all 13 are in one lane, that could cause a significant backlog.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the width. If 13 trucks are placed side by side across the width of the bridge, which is about 31 feet per lane, that would require each truck to be about 2.4 feet wide, which is not possible for a Mac Truck. So that interpretation doesn't make sense. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that 13 trucks are lined up end to end in a single lane, taking up 260 feet of the bridge's length.

Plus, the bridge has traffic moving in both directions, so having 13 trucks block the entire width would create a huge backup and probably a collision risk. So yeah, I think the answer is yes, they would jam up the bridge.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen consists of 13 Mac Trucks. Assuming each Mac Truck is about 9 feet wide, 13 trucks would span 117 feet.

They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge.

So, three lanes each 12 feet wide would make 36 feet wide. But wait, that seems a bit narrow. Maybe each lane is wider, like 12 feet, so three lanes would be 36 feet. But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Let me think about the actual dimensions. The Golden Gate Bridge is 8,981 feet long and 9,200 feet including anchor cables. Its width is about 90 feet, including the sidewalks. So, the road deck is 90 feet wide. If there are six lanes, that's 6 lanes divided by 90 feet, which would make each lane about 15 feet wide. That seems more reasonable. So, each lane is approximately 15 feet wide. Now, a Mac Truck is a large truck, maybe around 8.5 feet wide. So, if each Mac Truck is 8.5 feet wide, and they're placed side by side, how many would fit in a 15-foot lane? Let's do the math: 15 feet divided by 8.5 feet per truck is roughly 1.76. So, you could fit about 1 or 2 Mac Trucks side by side in a lane. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 8.5 times 2 is 17, which is wider than 15. So, actually, you can only fit 1 Mac Truck per lane, as 2 would exceed the lane width. So, each lane can only hold one Mac Truck. Therefore, with six lanes, you can have six Mac Trucks side by side. But the question is about a baker's dozen, which is 13. So, 13 Mac Trucks would need more lanes than the bridge has. Since the bridge only has six lanes, you can't fit 13 side by side. Also, even if the bridge had more lanes, the total width might not allow for 13 trucks. Wait, the bridge is 90 feet wide. If each Mac Truck is 8.5 feet, then 13 trucks would take up 13 * 8.5 = 110.5 feet. But the bridge's road deck is only 90 feet wide.

Each traffic lane is 12 feet wide, and there are two of them, one in each direction. So, the total width for traffic is 24 feet, plus the side emergency lanes, maybe another 12 feet each. So total width is around 24 + 24 = 48 feet? Wait, that doesn't add up because I've seen photos where the bridge looks wider. Maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. \n\nLet me think again. The Golden Gate Bridge is 1.7 miles long, but the width is more relevant here. I think the total width including all lanes is about 90 feet. So, if each traffic lane is 12 feet wide, and there are two in each direction, that's 24 feet for traffic, plus maybe 12 feet for the median and emergency lanes. So total around 36 feet. That seems tight. \n\nNow, 13 Mac Trucks, each about 10 feet wide, would take up 130 feet. That's way more than the bridge's width. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the bridge isn't that wide. Maybe the trucks are not 10 feet wide each. Let me check the width of a standard Mac Truck. A typical semi-truck trailer is about 8.5 feet wide, but a Mac Truck, being a heavy-duty truck, might be a bit wider, say 9 or 10 feet. So 13 trucks at 10 feet each would be 130 feet. But if the bridge is only 90 feet wide, that can't happen. So maybe the trucks are narrower. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Golden Gate Bridge is wider than I thought. Maybe it's 100 feet wide. Even then, 130 feet is too much. So, 13 trucks side by side would require a width of at least 130 feet, which the bridge doesn't have. Therefore, they wouldn't fit side by side on the bridge. So, if they tried to go side by side, they would indeed jam up the bridge because there's not enough space. \n\nWait, but maybe the bridge has multiple levels or separate lanes for different types of vehicles. But I don't think so; the Golden Gate Bridge has two main traffic decks. So, even if they tried to line them up on both decks, 13 trucks would still take up more space than available. Therefore, the answer is yes, they would jam up the bridge.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen consists of 13 items. Mac Trucks are large vehicles, each approximately 10 feet wide. If lined up side by side, 13 Mac Trucks would occupy 130 feet. The Golden Gate Bridge has a total width of about 90 feet, which is insufficient to accommodate 13 trucks side by side. Therefore, they would indeed jam up the bridge.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

If there are, say, 8 lanes total, that's 96 feet wide. But that's the total width for all lanes combined. If the trucks are side by side, they'd each take one lane. So 13 trucks would require 13 lanes. But the bridge only has 8 lanes, so 13 trucks would definitely not fit side by side because there's not enough space. \n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the number of lanes. Let me think again. The Golden Gate Bridge has 8 traffic lanes in total, divided into two sections: six for cars and two for buses or something. So, 6 car lanes and 2 lanes that can be used for traffic or emergency vehicles. If each lane is about 12 feet wide, 8 lanes would be 96 feet wide. So, 13 Mac Trucks, each taking one lane, would require 13 lanes, but the bridge only has 8. So, they can't all fit side by side. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about whether 13 trucks would cause a traffic jam, not necessarily all fitting side by side. If 13 trucks were driving across the bridge one after another, would that back up traffic? Well, the bridge is about 1.7 miles long, so if 13 trucks were moving slowly, it might cause a backup, but it's not about jamming the bridge's width but rather the flow of traffic. But the question specifically mentions \"side by side,\" so it's about fitting across the bridge's width. \n\nSo, considering the bridge's width and the number of lanes, 13 Mac Trucks can't all fit side by side because the bridge doesn't have enough lanes. Therefore, they would indeed jam up the bridge because there's not enough space for all of them to be side by side at once. Wait, but earlier I thought the bridge is wider than 13 lanes. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the actual width. \n\nUpon checking, the Golden Gate Bridge is 9,874 feet long, 1.7 miles, but its width is about 1,800 feet across, including all the lanes and walkways. Each lane is about 12 feet wide. So, 8 lanes would be 96 feet wide. If each Mac Truck is 10 feet wide, 13 trucks would take 130 feet. But the bridge's total width is much larger, so maybe they can fit. Wait, no, because the lanes are only 8, so 13 trucks can't fit side by side in the existing lanes. They would have to go one after the other, causing a traffic jam because there's no space for all of them to be on the bridge at the same time. \n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify: the question is whether 13 Mac Trucks side by side would cause a jam. If the bridge's width can't accommodate 13 trucks side by side, then yes, it would jam. But if the bridge is wide enough, then no. I think the bridge's total width is about 1,800 feet, but the usable width for traffic is about 96 feet (8 lanes). So, 13 trucks at 10 feet each would need 130 feet, which is more than 96 feet. Therefore, they can't all fit side by side, so they would cause a jam because there's no space for all of them to be on the bridge simultaneously. \n\nWait, but the bridge's total width is much larger, so maybe there's space for 13 trucks. If each lane is 12 feet, 13 lanes would require 156 feet, but the bridge is 1,800 feet wide. So, 156 feet is much less than 1,800, meaning there's plenty of space. So, 13 trucks could fit side by side, but the bridge only has 8 lanes. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the trucks can utilize the entire width of the bridge beyond the existing lanes, which they can't because the lanes are fixed. So, the answer is no, they wouldn't jam the bridge because they can fit within the available lanes, but since 13 is more than 8, they would cause a traffic jam by having to queue up. \n\nWait, no, the question is about whether they would jam the bridge, not necessarily cause a traffic jam on the road leading to it.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Let's say each lane is about 12 feet wide. So, if there are, say, 8 lanes, that's 8 times 12, which is 96 feet wide. But that's the total width of the bridge, so each lane is 12 feet. Now, how wide is a Mac Truck? I'm not exactly sure, but I think a standard semi-truck is about 8.5 feet wide. So, if each Mac Truck is about 8.5 feet wide, then 13 of them side by side would be 13 times 8.5, which is 110.5 feet. Wait, that's more than the 96 feet of the bridge's width. Hmm, that might be a problem. But wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the bridge's width. Maybe each lane is 12 feet, and there are 8 lanes, so 96 feet total. If the trucks are 8.5 feet each, 13 times 8.5 is 110.5, which is wider than 96. So, that would mean that 13 trucks side by side would be wider than the bridge itself. But bridges usually have some clearance, maybe extra space for safety. Maybe the bridge is wider than the sum of the lanes? Or perhaps I'm not considering the structure correctly. Alternatively, maybe the trucks wouldn't be all in a single row but spread out in different lanes. But the question says \"side by side,\" so I think they're all lined up in one direction. If the bridge is 96 feet wide and the trucks take up 110.5 feet when lined up, that would mean they wouldn't fit without overlapping. But wait, maybe the bridge's total width isn't just the lanes.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Let me check that... Oh, right, the Golden Gate Bridge has six lanes total, divided into two directions, so three lanes each way. Each lane is typically about 12 feet wide, I believe. So, three lanes would be 36 feet wide. Now, how wide is a Mac Truck? I think a standard Mac Truck, like a semi-truck, is about 8.5 feet wide. If I have 13 of them side by side, that would be 13 multiplied by 8.5 feet. Let me calculate that: 13 * 8.5 = 110.5 feet. Wait, that seems really wide. The bridge's total width is about 90 feet for the road, but I might be mixing up the numbers. Let me confirm: the Golden Gate Bridge's road is 90 feet wide, including six lanes. So, 90 feet divided by six lanes is 15 feet per lane, which seems a bit more than I thought earlier. Maybe the lanes are wider. If each lane is 15 feet, then three lanes would be 45 feet. But that's still less than the 110.5 feet required for 13 Mac Trucks. That means 13 of them side by side would definitely not fit on the bridge. So, they would likely cause a jam because they wouldn't fit within the bridge's width. Therefore, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge has a total road width of 90 feet, divided into six lanes.

Therefore, 13 Mac Trucks side by side would not fit within the bridge's lanes, leading to a traffic jam.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

So, putting it all together, 13 Mac Trucks side by side would likely exceed the bridge's width, leading to a traffic jam. Therefore, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen consists of 13 items. Mac Trucks are large vehicles, each approximately 8 feet wide. The Golden Gate Bridge has multiple lanes, each about 12 feet wide. Calculating the total width needed for 13 Mac Trucks: 13 x 8 feet = 104 feet. If each lane is 12 feet wide, 13 trucks would span more than one lane, potentially requiring two lanes. However, the bridge's design and traffic flow may not accommodate this without causing congestion. Thus, 13 Mac Trucks side by side would likely cause a traffic jam on the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

But that's stretching the interpretation of \"side by side.\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is more about whether the number of trucks would cause a traffic jam, not whether they physically fit. If 13 large trucks entered the bridge at the same time, they might cause a backup because the bridge has limited capacity. But the Golden Gate Bridge can handle a lot of traffic, so 13 trucks might not cause a major jam. \n\nBut the question specifically asks if they would \"jam up\" the bridge, which I think refers to physically blocking it. So, if 13 Mac Trucks are arranged side by side, their combined width would exceed the bridge's deck width, causing a blockage. Therefore, the answer would be yes, they would jam up the bridge because they wouldn't fit side by side across the bridge's width. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact dimensions. Maybe the bridge is wider than I thought. Let me think again. The total width of the Golden Gate Bridge's deck is 90 feet, as I mentioned earlier. Each Mac Truck is about 8 feet wide. So, 13 trucks would be 104 feet, which is wider than 90 feet. That means they wouldn't fit side by side across the bridge's width, causing a jam. \n\nSo, putting it all together, yes, a baker's dozen (13) of Mac Trucks arranged side by side would exceed the width of the Golden Gate Bridge's deck, leading to a jam.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen consists of 13 items. If each Mac Truck is approximately 8 feet wide, 13 trucks arranged side by side would span 104 feet. The Golden Gate Bridge's deck is about 90 feet wide, which is narrower than the combined width of the trucks. Therefore, 13 Mac Trucks placed side by side would exceed the bridge's width, causing a physical blockage.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me think again. The Golden Gate Bridge has two main traffic lanes, each with multiple lanes. Wait, no, I think each direction has multiple lanes. Let me check my facts. I think the bridge has a total of 10 traffic lanes, five in each direction. So each direction has five lanes. If each lane is about 12 feet wide, then 5 lanes would be 60 feet wide. So, if the bridge is 60 feet wide in each direction, and the trucks are 10 feet wide each, then 13 trucks side by side would require 130 feet, which is way wider than the bridge's 60 feet. That seems impossible because the bridge isn't that wide. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. If each lane is 12 feet, and there are five lanes, that's 60 feet total. So, 13 trucks at 10 feet each would take up 130 feet, which is more than the bridge's 60 feet. So, that means they wouldn't fit side by side on the bridge. Therefore, trying to have 13 Mac Trucks side by side on the Golden Gate Bridge would cause a jam because they wouldn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the bridge is wider. I think the total width from edge to edge is about 90 feet, but the road itself is about 60 feet wide for all lanes combined. So, even if the bridge is 90 feet wide, 13 trucks at 10 feet each would still require 130 feet, which is more than 90. So, they wouldn't fit, leading to a jam. Another angle: the Golden Gate Bridge's deck is about 90 feet wide, including all lanes and walkways. So, 13 trucks at 10 feet each would need 130 feet, which is more than the deck's width. Hence, they can't all fit side by side without overlapping, causing a traffic jam.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. So, if each lane is wide enough for a car, how much space would a Mac Truck take? I'm guessing a Mac Truck is wider than a standard car. Maybe about 10 feet wide? If each lane is, say, 12 feet wide for a car, then a Mac Truck might take up the entire lane.

But maybe the total width is more because of the structure. Actually, I think the Golden Gate Bridge is about 90 feet wide for the traffic lanes, including all lanes and maybe some shoulders. So 90 feet versus 110.5 feet. That means the 13 trucks would take up more space than the bridge's width. Therefore, they wouldn't fit side by side on the bridge. So, if you tried to line up 13 Mac Trucks across the bridge, they would exceed the bridge's width, causing a jam or overflow. So the answer should be yes, they would jam up the bridge.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is 90 feet wide for traffic, consisting of three lanes in each direction. Each Mac Truck is approximately 8.5 feet wide. A baker's dozen is 13 trucks, so 13 times 8.5 feet equals 110.5 feet, which exceeds the bridge's 90-foot width. Therefore, the trucks would not fit side by side and would cause a jam.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so 13 of them next to each other could take up a lot of space. Next, I should consider the width of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco. I'm not exactly sure of the exact width, but I think it's pretty wide to accommodate cars, buses, and maybe even some pedestrians. I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. Let me try to find the exact number of lanes. Oh, right, the Golden Gate Bridge has six lanes total, divided into two directions. So three lanes in each direction. Now, each lane's width is something I need to consider. I believe each lane is about 12 feet wide. So three lanes would be 36 feet wide. But wait, that's just the driving lanes. There might be shoulders or other structures on the bridge, but let's focus on the main traffic area. Now, if each Mac Truck is, say, 8.5 feet wide (I think that's a standard semi-truck width), then 13 of them side by side would be 13 times 8.5 feet. Let me calculate that: 13 * 8.5 = 110.5 feet. So 110.5 feet is the total width of 13 Mac Trucks placed side by side. Now, comparing that to the bridge's width. If the bridge is 102 feet wide for traffic (assuming 3 lanes at 12 feet each plus some space), but wait, earlier I thought each lane is about 12 feet, so 3 lanes would be 36 feet.
