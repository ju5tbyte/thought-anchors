If each lane is 12 feet wide and there are, say, 6 lanes total (3 in each direction), that would make the total width 72 feet. Now, how much space does a Mac Truck take? A standard semi-truck is about 8.5 feet wide, but Mac Trucks might be a bit wider because they're heavy-duty. Let's assume each Mac Truck is around 9 feet wide.\n\nIf I have 13 Mac Trucks side by side, each taking up 9 feet, that would be 13 * 9 = 117 feet. Wait, that seems way more than the 72 feet width of the bridge. So 117 feet is wider than the bridge's 72 feet. That suggests that even if they were all lined up, they wouldn't fit side by side on the bridge because the bridge isn't wide enough to accommodate all 13 trucks at once.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me double-check. Each lane is 12 feet, so 6 lanes would be 72 feet. If each truck is 9 feet, 13 trucks would take up 117 feet. That's almost double the bridge's width. So, it's impossible for 13 trucks to be side by side on the bridge because the bridge isn't wide enough.\n\nAnother angle: traffic flow. The bridge has traffic moving in both directions, so even if the trucks were arranged somehow, the bridge's structure and traffic lanes wouldn't allow 13 trucks to be side by side. Plus, the height of the trucks might be an issue, but the main problem here is the width.\n\nSo, considering the width of the bridge and the space each truck occupies, 13 Mac Trucks side by side would definitely not fit. Therefore, they wouldn't jam up the bridge because they can't all be side by side on it.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen is 13 items, so 13 Mac Trucks are considered. Each Mac Truck is approximately 9 feet wide. The Golden Gate Bridge has a total width of 72 feet across its six lanes. Calculating the total width of 13 trucks: 13 * 9 = 117 feet, which exceeds the bridge's 72 feet. Therefore, the trucks cannot fit side by side, and they would not jam up the bridge.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

If the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe 6 or 8, each lane being around that width. So, the total width of the bridge would be, say, 6 lanes times 12 feet each, which is 72 feet. But wait, maybe it's fewer lanes? I think it's actually 8 lanes in total\u20144 in each direction. So that's 4 lanes each way, each 12 feet wide, totaling 48 feet for each direction.\n\nNow, each Mac Truck is pretty long. I think a standard Mac Truck, like a semi-truck, is about 53 feet long, including the trailer. But if they're side by side, how much space would 13 of them take? If each is 53 feet, 13 of them would be 13 * 53 = 689 feet. That's a lot. But wait, the bridge is only about 1.7 miles long, which is 8976 feet. So, 689 feet is a small fraction of that. But the issue isn't the length of the bridge but the width of the bridge and whether the trucks can fit side by side without blocking traffic.\n\nWait, the question is about whether they would \"jam up\" the bridge. So, maybe it's more about whether the width of 13 trucks would exceed the bridge's width. If the bridge is 48 feet wide for all lanes, and each truck is, say, 8 feet wide (assuming a typical truck width), then 13 trucks would take up 13 * 8 = 104 feet.

They would need to be side by side within the 48 feet, but 13 trucks at 8 feet each would require 104 feet, which is way more than the 48 feet available.

The question says \"side by side.\" So, if they are placed side by side along the bridge, how would that work? The bridge's width is 36 feet, so if each truck is 8.5 feet wide, you can fit about 4 trucks per direction because 4 * 8.5 is 34 feet, which is just under 36 feet. So in each direction, maybe 4 trucks can fit side by side without overlapping. But the question is about 13 trucks. So, 13 divided by 4 is about 3.25. That means you would need at least 4 lanes to fit all 13 trucks side by side because each lane can hold 4 trucks. But the Golden Gate Bridge only has 3 lanes in each direction, so even if you use all 3 lanes, you can fit 3 * 4 = 12 trucks. That leaves one truck that doesn't fit.

From what I remember, it's one of the most iconic bridges in the US, spanning the Golden Gate Strait. It's a suspension bridge with two main towers and a long central span. The bridge has multiple lanes, I believe six or more, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nNow, if we have 13 Mac Trucks placed side by side, how much space would that take? Each Mac Truck is probably about the length of a standard semi-truck, maybe 10-15 meters long. If I line them up, 13 of them would be around 130-195 meters in total length. But wait, the bridge isn't that long. The main span of the Golden Gate Bridge is about 2,332 meters, but that's the total length including the approaches. The actual bridge deck is much wider.\n\nWait, no, the main span is the distance between the two towers, which is about 1,280 meters. So, 13 trucks side by side would be much shorter than the bridge itself. But that's not the issue. The problem is whether they can fit on the bridge without causing a jam or blockage.\n\nEach lane on the Golden Gate Bridge is designed to handle regular traffic, including cars, trucks, and buses. The number of lanes is important here. I think the bridge has six lanes, three in each direction. So, if each lane can handle a certain number of trucks, 13 might be too many for the bridge's capacity at any given time.\n\nAnother factor is the width of each lane. If each lane is, say, 3.5 meters wide, and the trucks are parked side by side, how many can fit across the bridge's width?

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty large and probably take up a lot of space.\n\nNext, I should consider the size of the Golden Gate Bridge. From what I remember, it's one of the most iconic bridges in the US, spanning the Golden Gate Strait. It's a suspension bridge with two main towers and a long central span. The bridge has multiple lanes, I believe six or more, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nNow, if we have 13 Mac Trucks placed side by side, how much space would that take? Each Mac Truck is probably about the length of a standard semi-truck, maybe 10-15 meters long. If I line them up, 13 of them would be around 130-195 meters in total length. But wait, the bridge isn't that long. The main span of the Golden Gate Bridge is about 2,332 meters, but that's the total length including the approaches. The actual bridge deck is much wider.\n\nWait, no, the main span is the distance between the two towers, which is about 1,280 meters. So, 13 trucks side by side would be much shorter than the bridge itself. But that's not the issue. The problem is whether they can fit on the bridge without causing a jam or blockage.\n\nEach lane on the Golden Gate Bridge is designed to handle regular traffic, including cars, trucks, and buses. The number of lanes is important here. I think the bridge has six lanes, three in each direction. So, if each lane can handle a certain number of trucks, 13 might be too many for the bridge's capacity at any given time.\n\nAnother factor is the width of each lane. If each lane is, say, 3.5 meters wide, and the trucks are parked side by side, how many can fit across the bridge's width? Let's see: if the bridge has six lanes, each about 3.5 meters wide, the total width would be 21 meters. If each Mac Truck is about 3 meters wide, then 7 trucks could fit across the bridge's width. But since a baker's dozen is 13, that's more than double. So, 13 trucks would require more space than the bridge's width allows.\n\nWait, but the question is about side by side, so maybe it's about how many can fit lengthwise on the bridge.

It's pretty narrow compared to modern bridges, I believe. I remember reading that it's about 746 feet wide, but I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, the key point is whether 13 of these large trucks, placed side by side, would cause a traffic jam on the bridge.\n\nLet me think about the width. Each Mac Truck is probably around 8 to 9 feet wide. If I take 13 of them and place them side by side, the total width would be 13 multiplied by, say, 8.5 feet. Let me do that math: 13 * 8.5 = 110.5 feet. Wait, that's over 100 feet wide. But the bridge itself is only about 700 feet long, but the question is about width. So if the bridge is 746 feet wide, and the trucks take up 110.5 feet when placed side by side, that's a significant portion of the bridge's width.\n\nBut wait, I think I might have confused the length and width. The Golden Gate Bridge's main span is about 4200 feet long, but its total width, including the two side spans, is about 800 feet. So, 13 trucks at 8.5 feet each would take up 110.5 feet. That's about 13.8% of the bridge's total width. Hmm, that might not be enough to cause a complete jam, but it could create a significant bottleneck, especially if they're all trying to move through at the same time.\n\nAnother factor is the height of the trucks. The Golden Gate Bridge has a clearance of about 190 feet above the water, so the trucks, being much shorter, shouldn't be an issue in terms of height. But if the bridge has specific lanes or weight limits, that could affect whether the trucks are even allowed to use it. I think the Golden Gate Bridge does have weight restrictions because it's an older bridge and not designed for the heaviest vehicles.\n\nWait, but the question is about whether they would jam up the bridge, not necessarily whether they're allowed to be there. So assuming they're allowed, would 13 of them side by side cause a traffic jam? Well, if the bridge's lanes are only wide enough for a certain number of vehicles, having 13 in a row might block the entire width, making it impossible for other vehicles to pass. That would definitely cause a jam.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the exact width of the bridge's lanes. If each lane is, say, 12 feet wide, then a single lane could fit maybe 1 or 2 trucks side by side. But the trucks are being placed side by side across the entire bridge's width, which might cover multiple lanes. So, if 13 trucks are placed side by side, they might span across multiple lanes, blocking all of them at once, which would cause a major traffic jam.\n\nAnother angle: the Golden Gate Bridge has two main traffic directions, each with multiple lanes. If all 13 trucks are in one direction, they might block all the lanes in that direction, causing a backup. But if they're spread out, maybe not. But the question says \"side by side,\" so I think they're all lined up in the same area, which would likely block the entire bridge.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 13 Mac Trucks placed side by side would take up a significant portion of the bridge's width, likely blocking all lanes and causing a traffic jam.

Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty large and probably take up a lot of space on the road.\n\nNow, the Golden Gate Bridge is a famous suspension bridge in San Francisco. It's pretty narrow compared to modern bridges. I remember reading somewhere that the bridge has two main lanes, but maybe each lane isn't extremely wide. I'm trying to visualize the width of the bridge. I think each lane is about 12 feet wide, but I'm not entirely sure. If each lane is 12 feet, and the trucks are parked side by side, how much space would they take?\n\nAssuming each Mac Truck is about 8.5 feet wide, which is a standard for large trucks, 13 of them side by side would take up 13 * 8.5 = 110.5 feet. Now, the Golden Gate Bridge is about 1.7 miles long, which is 8,976 feet. But the width is what matters here for fitting the trucks side by side. I think the bridge's width is around 90 feet, but I'm not certain. If the bridge is only 90 feet wide, and the trucks take up 110.5 feet, that's wider than the bridge itself. That would mean the trucks wouldn't fit side by side across the bridge. So, they would likely block the entire bridge, causing a jam.\n\nWait, but maybe the bridge has more than two lanes? Let me think. No, I believe it's two lanes total, each 12 feet wide. So that's 24 feet for both lanes. If the trucks are 8.5 feet each, 13 trucks would require 110.5 feet, which is way more than 24 feet. So, they wouldn't just block one lane; they'd need multiple lanes, but since there are only two, it's impossible to fit all 13 without overlapping and causing a jam.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the bridge's clearance is an issue. Mac Trucks are tall, so if the bridge's vertical clearance is low, the trucks might not even be able to pass under it. But I think the Golden Gate Bridge has enough clearance for trucks, so that's probably not the main issue here.\n\nSo, considering the width needed for 13 trucks and the limited width of the bridge, it's clear that they wouldn't fit side by side without blocking the entire bridge. Therefore, yes, a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen refers to 13 items. Mac Trucks are large vehicles, each approximately 8.5 feet wide. The Golden Gate Bridge is about 90 feet wide, with two lanes each 12 feet wide. Calculating the total width required for 13 Mac Trucks side by side: 13 * 8.5 = 110.5 feet. Since this exceeds the bridge's width, the trucks would not fit without overlapping, causing a jam.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

I remember reading that the bridge has two main lanes, one in each direction. Wait, no, maybe more? I'm not sure about the exact number of lanes.\n\nLet me think about the dimensions. The Golden Gate Bridge is about 8,000 feet long, but the actual road part, the deck, is maybe 70 feet wide? I'm not certain, but I think the width includes multiple lanes. If I assume it's four lanes total, that's two in each direction. So each lane would be about 12-15 feet wide. Let me check that in my mind. Yeah, standard highway lanes are around 12 feet wide.\n\nSo, if each lane is 12 feet wide and there are four lanes, that's 48 feet total width for the bridge's deck. Now, each Mac Truck is quite large. I'm not exactly sure about their exact dimensions, but I know they're longer and wider than regular trucks. Let's say each Mac Truck is about 14 feet long and 8 feet wide. That's a rough estimate.\n\nIf I have 13 Mac Trucks placed side by side, how much space would that take? If each is 8 feet wide, 13 times 8 is 104 feet. That's way wider than the 48 feet of the bridge's deck.

I remember it's pretty long, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact measurements. I think it's about 8,000 feet long, but that might include the approaches. The main span is maybe around 4,200 feet. The bridge has two lanes in each direction, so four lanes total, I believe. Each lane is probably wide enough for regular cars, maybe about 12 feet wide per lane. But trucks are wider than cars, so when they're side by side, they might take up more space.\n\nWait, but the question is about 13 Mac Trucks being side by side. So, how much space would that take? If each Mac Truck is, say, 14 feet wide, and they're side by side, 13 of them would take up 13 times 14 feet, which is 182 feet. That's a lot. But the bridge's lanes are only about 12 feet wide each. So, if they're side by side, they might not all fit within the lanes. Maybe they would have to go one after the other, but the question specifies side by side, so perhaps they'd be parked across the bridge's width.\n\nBut wait, the Golden Gate Bridge has a clearance for vehicles. I think the height of the bridge above the water is about 746 feet, and the vertical clearance for ships is around 220 feet. But that's not directly relevant here. The issue is whether the trucks can physically fit on the bridge without causing a blockage.\n\nEach truck is probably about 50 feet long, so 13 of them would be 650 feet long. The bridge is about 8,000 feet long, so 650 feet is a small portion of that. But if they're all lined up side by side across the width, which is 182 feet, and the bridge is only so wide, maybe that's not possible. The bridge's width is about 90 feet, I think, including all lanes and sidewalks. So, 182 feet is wider than the bridge itself. That means they couldn't all fit side by side without extending beyond the bridge's width.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for 13 Mac Trucks to be parked side by side across the entire width of the Golden Gate Bridge because the bridge isn't wide enough. They'd have to be in a single line, which would take up a significant portion of the length but wouldn't block the bridge entirely. So, the answer is no, they wouldn't jam up the bridge because they can't all fit side by side across its width.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen is 13 Mac Trucks, which are large and heavy-duty vehicles. The Golden Gate Bridge is about 8,000 feet long with four lanes, each around 12 feet wide. If the trucks are side by side, their combined width would be 182 feet, exceeding the bridge's total width of approximately 90 feet. Therefore, they cannot fit side by side across the bridge's width, making it impossible to jam up the bridge.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

It would cause a massive traffic jam because there's just not enough space for that many vehicles to be on the bridge simultaneously.\n\nWait, but maybe the bridge has some extra space for emergencies or breakdowns? I don't think so; most bridges are designed to have just enough space for the traffic they handle. The Golden Gate Bridge is pretty busy, so it's optimized for regular traffic flow, not for 13 trucks side by side.\n\nAlso, considering the height of the trucks, but I think the bridge's clearance is sufficient for most trucks. But the main issue here is the width and the number of trucks. So, putting it all together, 13 Mac Trucks side by side would definitely cause a jam on the Golden Gate Bridge because they exceed the bridge's width capacity.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge has a total width of 48 feet across its four lanes, while a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks (13 trucks) would occupy 110.5 feet when placed side by side.

I think each lane is about 12 feet wide, but I might be mixing that up with other bridges. Let me think... Yeah, I think each traffic lane is around 12 feet wide.\n\nNow, Mac Trucks. How wide are they? I'm picturing a typical Mac Truck, like the ones used for construction. They're pretty long, but in terms of width, I think they're about 8.5 feet wide, maybe a bit more. So if each Mac Truck is roughly 8.5 feet wide, and we have 13 of them side by side, that would be 13 multiplied by 8.5 feet. Let me calculate that: 13 * 8.5 = 110.5 feet. So, 110.5 feet of width.\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge has two traffic lanes, each about 12 feet wide. So combined, the traffic lanes are 24 feet wide. But wait, is that all? There's also the median in the middle, right? I think the bridge has a central barrier, so the total width might be a bit more. Let's say the median is 5 feet wide. That would make the total width of the bridge's roadways 24 + 5 = 29 feet.\n\nBut wait, if we're considering the two traffic lanes only, that's 24 feet. So, 13 Mac Trucks side by side would take up 110.5 feet, which is way more than the 24 feet available. That seems like a lot. But wait, the bridge is a suspension bridge, and I think the actual width might be a bit more because there are also sidewalks. Oh right, the Golden Gate Bridge has two sidewalks, each about 5 feet wide. So adding those, the total width would be 24 (lanes) + 5 (median) + 10 (sidewalks) = 39 feet.\n\nBut the question is about the traffic lanes, so the 13 trucks would need to fit within the 24 feet of traffic lanes. Since 13 trucks at 8.5 feet each would take up 110.5 feet, which is way wider than 24 feet, it's impossible to fit them side by side on the bridge. Therefore, they would definitely jam up the bridge because they wouldn't fit within the available width.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Is it asking if 13 Mac Trucks, each placed side by side, would cause a traffic jam? Or is it about whether they can physically fit on the bridge? If it's the latter, then based on the width, they can't fit. If it's the former, even if they fit, having 13 trucks on the bridge at once would cause a jam. But I think the question is more about whether they can physically fit, leading to a jam because they can't all be on the bridge at the same time.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the Golden Gate Bridge's traffic lanes are too narrow to accommodate 13 side-by-side Mac Trucks, so they would indeed jam up the bridge.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge's traffic lanes are each about 12 feet wide, totaling 24 feet for both lanes.

I think each lane is about 12 feet wide, but I might be mixing that up with other bridges. Let me think... Yeah, I think each traffic lane is around 12 feet wide.\n\nNow, Mac Trucks. How wide are they? I'm picturing a typical Mac Truck, like the ones used for construction. They're pretty long, but in terms of width, I think they're about 8.5 feet wide, maybe a bit more. So if each Mac Truck is roughly 8.5 feet wide, and we have 13 of them side by side, that would be 13 multiplied by 8.5 feet. Let me calculate that: 13 * 8.5 = 110.5 feet. So, 110.5 feet of width.\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge has two traffic lanes, each about 12 feet wide. So combined, the traffic lanes are 24 feet wide. But wait, is that all? There's also the median in the middle, right? I think the bridge has a central barrier, so the total width might be a bit more. Let's say the median is 5 feet wide. That would make the total width of the bridge's roadways 24 + 5 = 29 feet.\n\nBut wait, if we're considering the two traffic lanes only, that's 24 feet. So, 13 Mac Trucks side by side would take up 110.5 feet, which is way more than the 24 feet available. That seems like a lot. But wait, the bridge is a suspension bridge, and I think the actual width might be a bit more because there are also sidewalks. Oh right, the Golden Gate Bridge has two sidewalks, each about 5 feet wide. So adding those, the total width would be 24 (lanes) + 5 (median) + 10 (sidewalks) = 39 feet.\n\nBut the question is about the traffic lanes, so the 13 trucks would need to fit within the 24 feet of traffic lanes. Since 13 trucks at 8.5 feet each would take up 110.5 feet, which is way wider than 24 feet, it's impossible to fit them side by side on the bridge. Therefore, they would definitely jam up the bridge because they wouldn't fit within the available width.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Is it asking if 13 Mac Trucks, each placed side by side, would cause a traffic jam? Or is it about whether they can physically fit on the bridge? If it's the latter, then based on the width, they can't fit. If it's the former, even if they fit, having 13 trucks on the bridge at once would cause a jam. But I think the question is more about whether they can physically fit, leading to a jam because they can't all be on the bridge at the same time.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the Golden Gate Bridge's traffic lanes are too narrow to accommodate 13 side-by-side Mac Trucks, so they would indeed jam up the bridge.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge's traffic lanes are each about 12 feet wide, totaling 24 feet for both lanes. A baker's dozen consists of 13 Mac Trucks, each approximately 8.5 feet wide. Placing 13 trucks side by side would require 110.5 feet of width, which far exceeds the 24 feet available on the bridge. Therefore, they would not fit and would cause a jam.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco, known for its distinctive orange color. It's one of the most iconic bridges in the world. I think it's about 8,000 feet long, but I'm not entirely sure. It's definitely a major thoroughfare for both cars and trucks, especially since it connects San Francisco to Marin County.\n\nNow, considering the size of the bridge and the trucks. Mac Trucks are pretty sizable. Let me think about their dimensions. I believe a standard Mac Truck might be around 50 feet long, maybe a bit more. If each truck is about 50 feet, then 13 of them side by side would be 13 times 50, which is 650 feet. Wait, that seems like a lot. But the Golden Gate Bridge's width\u2014I think the road is wide enough for multiple lanes. I think it has multiple lanes for both vehicles and pedestrians, maybe even separate lanes for bikes.\n\nBut wait, the bridge's width is actually about 90 feet wide for the road, if I recall correctly. So, if each lane is, say, 12 feet wide, and there are multiple lanes, maybe two or three. Let me check that. If the bridge has, say, 8 traffic lanes, that's 8 times 12 feet, which is 96 feet. So the road is 90 feet wide, which would allow for about 7.5 lanes. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Maybe the lanes are a bit wider.\n\nWait, perhaps the bridge's total width is 90 feet, and each lane is about 12 feet wide. So, 90 divided by 12 is 7.5 lanes. So, it's probably designed for about 7 or 8 lanes. That means if all the lanes are filled with trucks, maybe 8 trucks could fit side by side. But the question is about 13 trucks. That's more than the number of lanes available.\n\nBut wait, maybe the trucks are not all in the same lane. Or perhaps the bridge can handle multiple trucks in each lane. However, in reality, each lane is for one vehicle at a time, especially for larger vehicles like trucks. So, if there are 8 lanes, and each can fit one truck, then 8 trucks could go through without a problem. But 13 is more than that.\n\nAnother angle: traffic flow. Even if the bridge has enough physical space, the traffic control and how vehicles move through the bridge would matter. If 13 trucks were to enter the bridge at the same time, even if they're spread across the lanes, it might cause congestion because the bridge's capacity is limited. But I'm not sure if 13 is beyond the bridge's capacity.\n\nI should also consider the height and weight limits. Mac Trucks are heavy, but the bridge has weight restrictions. However, the question is about whether they would \"jam up,\" which refers more to physical space rather than weight or height. So, focusing on the width and number of lanes.\n\nWait, maybe the Golden Gate Bridge has more lanes than I thought. Let me think again. I think it has six lanes total, three in each direction. So, if each lane is 12 feet wide, that's 36 feet per direction. So, 13 trucks at 50 feet each would require 650 feet, but that's not the way it works. Instead, the number of trucks that can fit side by side would depend on the number of lanes. If there are six lanes, maybe two trucks per lane, but that's still not enough for 13.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the trucks are moving one after the other, not side by side. But the question specifies \"side by side,\" so they're trying to occupy the same space simultaneously, which isn't possible on a bridge.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the Golden Gate Bridge has a certain number of lanes, probably around six. Each lane can fit one truck at a time. Therefore, 13 trucks would require more lanes than available, leading to a jam because they can't all fit side by side without blocking each other.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge has six lanes, typically three in each direction.

I know it's pretty busy with traffic, but I'm not exactly sure about its dimensions. I should check how wide the bridge is. From what I remember, the Golden Gate Bridge is about 1.7 miles long, but the width is more critical here. I think each lane is about 12 feet wide, and there are multiple lanes. Let me see, maybe 8 lanes in total, so that's 8 times 12, which is 96 feet wide. Wait, no, that seems too wide. Maybe each lane is 12 feet, and there are 6 lanes, so 72 feet? I'm not entirely sure, but I'll go with 72 feet for the total width.\n\nEach Mac Truck is pretty long. Let's say each is about 50 feet long, including the trailer. If they're side by side, the total length for 13 trucks would be 13 times 50, which is 650 feet. That's a lot longer than the bridge's total length of 1.7 miles, which is 8912 feet. Wait, no, the bridge is 1.7 miles long, so 1.7 times 5280 is approximately 8976 feet. So 650 feet is much shorter than the bridge's length. But wait, the question is about the width, not the length.\n\nIf each truck is, say, 8.5 feet wide, then 13 trucks side by side would take up 13 * 8.5 = 110.5 feet. Now, the bridge's total width is 72 feet as I thought earlier. 110.5 feet is way more than 72 feet. That means 13 trucks side by side would not fit across the bridge's width. They would definitely overlap and cause a jam because there's no way to fit that many trucks across the bridge without blocking each other.\n\nAlso, the Golden Gate Bridge has a weight limit.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty long and wide, so if you line them up side by side, that's going to take up a lot of space.\n\nNow, the Golden Gate Bridge is a famous suspension bridge in San Francisco. I know it's pretty busy with traffic, but I'm not exactly sure about its dimensions. I should check how wide the bridge is. From what I remember, the Golden Gate Bridge is about 1.7 miles long, but the width is more critical here. I think each lane is about 12 feet wide, and there are multiple lanes. Let me see, maybe 8 lanes in total, so that's 8 times 12, which is 96 feet wide. Wait, no, that seems too wide. Maybe each lane is 12 feet, and there are 6 lanes, so 72 feet? I'm not entirely sure, but I'll go with 72 feet for the total width.\n\nEach Mac Truck is pretty long. Let's say each is about 50 feet long, including the trailer. If they're side by side, the total length for 13 trucks would be 13 times 50, which is 650 feet. That's a lot longer than the bridge's total length of 1.7 miles, which is 8912 feet. Wait, no, the bridge is 1.7 miles long, so 1.7 times 5280 is approximately 8976 feet. So 650 feet is much shorter than the bridge's length. But wait, the question is about the width, not the length.\n\nIf each truck is, say, 8.5 feet wide, then 13 trucks side by side would take up 13 * 8.5 = 110.5 feet. Now, the bridge's total width is 72 feet as I thought earlier. 110.5 feet is way more than 72 feet. That means 13 trucks side by side would not fit across the bridge's width. They would definitely overlap and cause a jam because there's no way to fit that many trucks across the bridge without blocking each other.\n\nAlso, the Golden Gate Bridge has a weight limit. Each Mac Truck is very heavy, and 13 of them would add up to a massive weight. Even if they could fit, the bridge might not be able to handle that much weight at once. Plus, traffic on the bridge moves in both directions, so having 13 trucks side by side would cause confusion and block all lanes, leading to a traffic jam.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the width of the bridge isn't enough to accommodate 13 Mac Trucks side by side, and the weight and traffic flow would make it impossible.

The bridge has two main lanes in each direction, so four lanes total, right? Each lane is probably about 12 feet wide, maybe a bit more. So four lanes would give a total width of around 48 feet.\n\nNow, how long is a Mac Truck? I'm not exactly sure, but I think a standard semi-truck with a trailer is about 53 feet long. If they're side by side, 13 of them would take up a lot of space. Let's do the math. If each Mac Truck is 53 feet long, 13 of them would be 13 * 53 = 689 feet long. That's almost 700 feet of trucks.

They're pretty long and wide, so I can imagine they take up a lot of space on the road.\n\nNow, the Golden Gate Bridge is a famous suspension bridge in San Francisco. It's pretty narrow compared to modern bridges, I believe. I remember reading that it's about 1.7 miles long, but the actual road on the bridge isn't super wide. I think each lane is maybe 12 feet wide or something like that. So, if there are multiple lanes, how many are there? I think it's two main traffic lanes in each direction, so four total, but maybe they're separated by a median.\n\nWait, no, I think the Golden Gate Bridge has two main traffic lanes, one in each direction, but they're divided by a median. So, the total width of the bridge's road might be something like 62 feet, with each lane being 12 feet wide. That means if you have two lanes, each 12 feet, plus the median, that adds up. So, 12 + 12 + 18 (for the median) equals 42 feet? Maybe I'm getting the numbers wrong, but the key point is that the bridge isn't very wide.\n\nNow, if we have 13 Mac Trucks parked side by side, how much space would they take? Let's assume each Mac Truck is about 12 feet wide. So, 13 trucks would take up 13 * 12 = 156 feet. That's a lot of space. The bridge's total width is nowhere near that. Wait, but the bridge's road is about 62 feet wide. So, 13 trucks at 12 feet each would need 156 feet, which is way more than the bridge's 62 feet. That means they wouldn't fit side by side on the bridge's road.\n\nBut wait, maybe the trucks are not all parked on the same part of the bridge. Maybe they're spread out? But the question says \"side by side,\" so I think they're all lined up together. So, 156 feet is way beyond the bridge's width. Therefore, they wouldn't fit. So, trying to park 13 Mac Trucks side by side on the Golden Gate Bridge would definitely cause a jam because there's not enough space.\n\nAnother angle: even if the bridge were wider, having that many trucks in one spot would block traffic. But in reality, the bridge isn't wide enough to accommodate 13 side-by-side trucks. So, yeah, it would jam up.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge's road is approximately 62 feet wide, with two 12-foot lanes and a median. A baker's dozen of 13 Mac Trucks, each about 12 feet wide, would require 156 feet of space, far exceeding the bridge's width. Therefore, they wouldn't fit side by side, causing a jam.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Wait, no, maybe each side has two lanes? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. No, I think each side has three lanes, making a total of six lanes across the bridge. That would be two lanes in each direction, I suppose, but I'm not entirely certain.

That means each lane is about 12 feet wide. Now, how long is a Mac Truck? A standard Mac Truck, like the ones used for construction, is pretty long. I think they're about 50 to 60 feet in length, including the trailer.\n\nIf each lane is 12 feet wide, and we're placing 13 Mac Trucks side by side, how much space would that take? Let's calculate. 13 trucks, each taking up 12 feet, would be 13 * 12 = 156 feet. But wait, the bridge is only so long. The Golden Gate Bridge is about 1.7 miles long, or roughly 8,900 feet. So, 156 feet is a small portion of that. But that's just the length; we also need to consider the width.\n\nWait, I think I got that mixed up. The 12 feet is the width of each lane, so if the trucks are placed side by side in a single lane, how many could fit? Each truck is 12 feet wide, so in a 12-foot lane, only one truck can fit without overlapping. But if they're side by side across multiple lanes, how does that work?\n\nWait, no. If we're talking about 13 trucks side by side across the bridge, we need to see how many lanes that would occupy. If each lane is 12 feet wide, then 13 trucks would require 13 * 12 = 156 feet of width. But the bridge only has six lanes, each 12 feet wide, so the total width is 6 * 12 = 72 feet. So, 13 trucks side by side would require 156 feet, but the bridge is only 72 feet wide. That means they wouldn't fit side by side across the bridge.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. The question is about whether 13 Mac Trucks, placed side by side, would block the bridge. So, if the bridge is 72 feet wide, and each truck is 12 feet wide, you can fit 6 trucks side by side, one in each lane. But 13 is more than 6, so you can't fit all 13 side by side on the bridge at the same time. They would have to go one after the other, but that's traffic flow, not side by side.\n\nSo, if all 13 trucks were trying to be on the bridge at the same time, side by side, that would require more width than the bridge provides. Therefore, they would jam up the bridge because there's no space for all of them to be side by side. They would block each other and cause a traffic jam.\n\nWait, but the bridge has a certain capacity. Maybe the question is about whether the number of trucks would exceed the bridge's capacity, causing a jam. So, considering that the bridge can handle a certain number of vehicles at a time, 13 might be more than that number, leading to congestion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about whether the length of the trucks would cause a jam. If each truck is 60 feet long, and the bridge is 8,900 feet long, 13 trucks would take up 13 * 60 = 780 feet of the bridge. That's a small fraction, so maybe not. But if they're all trying to enter the bridge at once, it could cause a backup on the approaches, not necessarily on the bridge itself.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to clarify. The Golden Gate Bridge has six lanes, each 12 feet wide. So, the maximum number of trucks that can be side by side without overlapping is six.

It's known for its iconic red color and its span over the Golden Gate Strait. I remember it's one of the most heavily traveled bridges in the US, handling a lot of traffic daily. But how wide is it? I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. So, each lane is designed to handle regular cars, maybe some trucks, but not sure about the exact width.\n\nNext, I should consider the width of a Mac Truck. I'm not exactly sure, but I know that most large trucks, like semi-trailers, are about 8.5 feet wide. If a Mac Truck is similar or slightly wider, let's say around 9 feet. So, 13 of these trucks placed side by side would add up to 13 multiplied by 9 feet, which is 117 feet. That's the total width they would occupy.\n\nNow, looking at the Golden Gate Bridge's width. From what I recall, the bridge is about 90 feet wide, with 6 lanes total. Wait, is that right? I think it's actually 7 lanes, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me double-check that. No, I think it's 8 lanes in total\u2014four in each direction. So, if it's 8 lanes, each lane is about 12 feet wide, but that's just a rough estimate. So, 8 lanes would be 8 times 12, which is 96 feet. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right because 13 trucks at 9 feet each would be 117 feet, which is wider than the bridge's total width.\n\nWait, maybe the lanes are wider. Let me think. If each lane is 12 feet wide, then 8 lanes would be 96 feet, but that's the total width of the bridge. So, the bridge's total width is 96 feet, and the 13 trucks side by side would take up 117 feet. That means they would definitely not fit because 117 is greater than 96. So, the trucks would extend beyond the bridge's width, causing a jam.\n\nBut wait, maybe the bridge's lanes are narrower. If each lane is 11 feet, then 8 lanes would be 88 feet. Then, 13 trucks at 9 feet each would be 117 feet, which is still wider. So, regardless, the total width of the trucks exceeds the bridge's width, meaning they wouldn't fit side by side. Therefore, they would cause a jam.\n\nAnother angle: traffic flow.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable, so I'm imagining them being quite long and wide.\n\nNow, the Golden Gate Bridge is a famous suspension bridge in San Francisco. It's known for its iconic red color and its span over the Golden Gate Strait. I remember it's one of the most heavily traveled bridges in the US, handling a lot of traffic daily. But how wide is it? I think the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe six or eight in each direction. So, each lane is designed to handle regular cars, maybe some trucks, but not sure about the exact width.\n\nNext, I should consider the width of a Mac Truck. I'm not exactly sure, but I know that most large trucks, like semi-trailers, are about 8.5 feet wide. If a Mac Truck is similar or slightly wider, let's say around 9 feet. So, 13 of these trucks placed side by side would add up to 13 multiplied by 9 feet, which is 117 feet. That's the total width they would occupy.\n\nNow, looking at the Golden Gate Bridge's width. From what I recall, the bridge is about 90 feet wide, with 6 lanes total. Wait, is that right? I think it's actually 7 lanes, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me double-check that. No, I think it's 8 lanes in total\u2014four in each direction. So, if it's 8 lanes, each lane is about 12 feet wide, but that's just a rough estimate. So, 8 lanes would be 8 times 12, which is 96 feet. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right because 13 trucks at 9 feet each would be 117 feet, which is wider than the bridge's total width.\n\nWait, maybe the lanes are wider. Let me think. If each lane is 12 feet wide, then 8 lanes would be 96 feet, but that's the total width of the bridge. So, the bridge's total width is 96 feet, and the 13 trucks side by side would take up 117 feet. That means they would definitely not fit because 117 is greater than 96. So, the trucks would extend beyond the bridge's width, causing a jam.\n\nBut wait, maybe the bridge's lanes are narrower. If each lane is 11 feet, then 8 lanes would be 88 feet. Then, 13 trucks at 9 feet each would be 117 feet, which is still wider. So, regardless, the total width of the trucks exceeds the bridge's width, meaning they wouldn't fit side by side. Therefore, they would cause a jam.\n\nAnother angle: traffic flow. Even if they could physically fit, the bridge's traffic system might not allow such a formation. Traffic lights and the way the bridge is designed for continuous flow might not accommodate 13 trucks parked side by side. It would block all lanes, causing a major traffic backup.\n\nSo, considering both the physical dimensions and the traffic infrastructure, a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks side by side would indeed jam up the Golden Gate Bridge.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen consists of 13 items.

I remember it's pretty narrow compared to modern bridges. I think each lane is about 12 feet wide. Let me check that... Yeah, I believe the bridge has two main traffic lanes, each 12 feet wide, plus some emergency lanes or shoulders. So, each lane is 12 feet wide.\n\nIf each Mac Truck is, say, 10 feet wide, that might be a starting point. But wait, actually, big trucks like the ones used for construction or heavy hauling can be up to 16 feet wide, especially with trailers attached. So maybe I should consider the maximum width to be around 16 feet per truck, including the trailer.\n\nNow, if each truck is 16 feet wide and we have 13 of them side by side, the total width would be 13 multiplied by 16 feet. Let me do that calculation: 13 * 16 = 208 feet. That's the total width these trucks would occupy.\n\nBut the Golden Gate Bridge's lanes are only 12 feet wide each. So, if we have two lanes, that's 24 feet in total. Wait, but the bridge is single-deck, so maybe it's two lanes in each direction? I think it's two lanes total, one in each direction. So, each direction has 12 feet.\n\nIf I have 13 trucks each taking up 16 feet, that's 208 feet. The bridge's lane is 12 feet wide. So, even if you place one truck per lane, each truck would take up the entire width of the lane, and you couldn't fit another one next to it because the lane isn't wide enough. So, in each lane, you can't have more than one truck at a time without them overlapping.\n\nBut wait, maybe the bridge has more than two lanes? Let me think. I believe the Golden Gate Bridge has four traffic lanes total, two in each direction. So, each direction has two lanes, each 12 feet wide. That means the total width for traffic in one direction is 24 feet (12 * 2). \n\nIf each truck is 16 feet wide, how many can fit in 24 feet? Let's see: 24 / 16 = 1.5. So, you could fit one and a half trucks, but obviously, you can't have half a truck. So, only one truck can fit in each lane without overlapping. Since there are two lanes in each direction, that's two trucks total on the bridge at any given time without overlapping.\n\nBut the question is about 13 trucks. Even if the bridge had more lanes, let's say hypothetically, how many lanes does it have? I'm pretty sure it's four lanes total, two in each direction. So, in each direction, two lanes. So, maximum, two trucks can be on the bridge side by side without overlapping.\n\nWait, but maybe the bridge is wider than that. Let me double-check the width. I think the total width of the bridge, including all lanes and shoulders, is about 72 feet. But the traffic lanes are only 12 feet each. So, four lanes would be 48 feet (12 * 4). The remaining 24 feet are for shoulders or other purposes.\n\nSo, even if we consider the total traffic lanes as 48 feet, how many 16-foot-wide trucks can fit? 48 / 16 = 3. So, three trucks could fit side by side in the four lanes. But wait, that's if you arrange them across all four lanes. But in reality, the lanes are divided into two directions, each with two lanes. So, each direction has two 12-foot lanes.\n\nSo, in one direction, you can fit two trucks, each taking up 12 feet. Wait, no, because each truck is 16 feet wide, which is wider than the lane. So, actually, each truck would require its own lane, and since each lane is 12 feet, the truck can't fit entirely within the lane without extending beyond. But maybe the question assumes that the trucks are arranged side by side across multiple lanes.\n\nBut if the bridge has four lanes, each 12 feet wide, and each truck is 16 feet wide, you can't fit even one truck in a single lane because it's wider than the lane. So, the trucks would have to be positioned across multiple lanes, but that's not practical because each lane is for a different direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is more about the length of the bridge and whether 13 trucks would block the bridge's length. The Golden Gate Bridge is about 1.7 miles long, or roughly 8,640 feet. If each truck is, say, 60 feet long (including trailer), then 13 trucks would take up 780 feet. That's much less than the total length, so they wouldn't block the entire bridge.\n\nBut the question is about jamming up the bridge, which I think refers to the width rather than the length. If 13 trucks are placed side by side across the bridge's width, which is 72 feet total, then 13 trucks at 16 feet each would require 208 feet, which is way more than the bridge's 72 feet.

    "chunk_resampled": "They're pretty long and wide.",
    "rollout": " They're pretty long and wide.\n\nNext, I should consider the size of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco, pretty famous. I think it's about 8,000 feet long, but I'm not entirely sure. The main span is around 4,200 feet, but the total length including the approaches is longer. Anyway, the bridge has two main lanes in each direction, I believe, so four lanes total. Each lane is wide enough for cars, but how wide is that exactly? Maybe 12 feet per lane? I'm not certain, but that's a common width for highways.\n\nNow, if we have 13 Mac Trucks, each probably around 15-20 feet in length, how much space would they take up side by side? If each is about 15 feet long, 13 of them would be 195 feet long. But wait, the question is about them being side by side, not one after the other. So, how wide is each Mac Truck? I think they're about 8-10 feet wide. So, 13 of them side by side would take up 130 feet in width. \n\nBut the bridge's lanes are only 12 feet wide each, and there are four lanes. So, four lanes would give a total width of 48 feet. If the trucks are 130 feet wide when placed side by side, that's way wider than the bridge's total width. That doesn't make sense because the bridge isn't that wide. So, maybe the trucks can't even fit side by side across all four lanes.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the question is about 13 Mac Trucks trying to cross the bridge at the same time, each taking up a lane. If each lane is 12 feet wide, and each truck is, say, 10 feet wide, then 13 trucks would require 130 feet of lane space. But each lane is only 12 feet wide. So, they can't fit side by side across the lanes. They would have to go one after the other, not side by side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the length of the trucks blocking the bridge. If each truck is 15 feet long, 13 of them in a line would be 195 feet. The bridge's total length is about 8,000 feet, so 195 feet is a small fraction. But traffic can move, so unless there's a bottleneck, maybe it wouldn't jam up. But if all 13 trucks are trying to enter the bridge at the same point, that could cause a traffic jam because they can't all fit on the bridge at once.\n\nAnother angle: the Golden Gate Bridge's traffic capacity. How many vehicles can it handle at a time? I think it's designed to handle a certain number of vehicles without congestion, but 13 trucks might not be enough to cause a jam. However, if all 13 trucks are entering the bridge at the same time, maybe in the same direction, they could block the on-ramp or cause a pile-up.\n\nWait, but the bridge has multiple lanes and traffic lights. So, maybe the traffic would flow as usual, and the 13 trucks wouldn't cause a jam. Or perhaps the question is more about the physical space: can 13 Mac Trucks fit side by side on the bridge? Since the bridge's lanes are only 12 feet wide each, and the trucks are wider than that, they wouldn't fit side by side across the lanes. So, they'd have to go one after the other, which would take up more space but not necessarily cause a jam unless there's a sudden stoppage.\n\nI'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the exact dimensions. The Golden Gate Bridge has a total width of about 90 feet, including the sidewalks and lanes. Each traffic lane is about 12 feet wide, with two lanes in each direction. So, four lanes in total, each 12 feet wide. A Mac Truck is about 11 feet wide. So, if you have 13 trucks, each 11 feet wide, side by side, that's 143 feet. The bridge's total width is 90 feet, so that's way wider than the bridge. Therefore, you can't fit 13 Mac Trucks side by side on the bridge because the bridge isn't that wide.\n\nWait, but the question is about them jamming up the bridge. So, if 13 trucks tried to enter the bridge at the same time, they would have to queue up, which could cause a traffic jam on the approach, but not necessarily on the bridge itself. The bridge's capacity is about how many vehicles can pass per hour, but 13 trucks at once might not exceed that. However, if they're all trying to enter the bridge at the same point, it could create a bottleneck.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is more about the physical width. Since the bridge isn't wide enough to fit all 13 trucks side by side, they can't all be on the bridge at the same time, which might mean they have to go one after the other, which could cause a queue but not necessarily a jam. But if the trucks are parked or stopped on the bridge, that could cause a blockage.\n\nI think the key point is that the Golden Gate Bridge's lanes are not wide enough to accommodate 13 Mac Trucks side by side. Each lane is 12 feet wide, and the trucks are about 11 feet wide, so even two trucks side by side would take up 22 feet, which is more than the 12 feet of a single lane. Therefore, they can't fit side by side across the lanes. So, they would have to go one after the other, which might cause a traffic queue but not necessarily a complete jam unless there's an obstruction.\n\nWait, but the question is whether they would jam up the bridge. If the trucks are too wide to fit side by side, they can't all be on the bridge at the same time, which might mean that the bridge's capacity is exceeded, causing a backlog. But I'm not sure if 13 trucks would be enough to cause a jam. Maybe during peak hours, but I'm not certain.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to summarize. The Golden Gate Bridge has four lanes, each about 12 feet wide. A Mac Truck is about 11 feet wide. So, each lane can fit one truck at a time. If 13 trucks try to enter the bridge, they would have to queue up, but since there are four lanes, maybe they can spread out across the lanes. However, 13 trucks across four lanes would mean about three or four trucks per lane, which might not cause a jam because each lane can handle traffic flow. But if all 13 trucks are trying to enter the bridge at the same exact spot, that could cause a pile-up or a jam at the entrance.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is about the physical width, since the bridge isn't wide enough to fit all 13 trucks side by side, they can't all be on the bridge simultaneously, which might lead to a queue but not necessarily a complete jam. It depends on how the traffic is managed and whether the trucks are spread out across the lanes.\n\nI'm still a bit unsure, but I think the main point is that the bridge's lanes aren't wide enough to fit 13 Mac Trucks side by side. Therefore, they can't all be on the bridge at the same time, which might cause a traffic queue but not necessarily a complete jam. Or maybe it would cause a jam because the trucks can't fit side by side, leading to congestion on the approach roads.\n\nHmm, I'm leaning towards yes, they would jam up the bridge because the physical space isn't enough to accommodate them all at once, causing a backlog. But I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should check if the bridge's total width is enough for 13 trucks. If each truck is 11 feet wide, 13 would need 143 feet, but the bridge is only 90 feet wide. So, no, they can't fit side by side, meaning they have to queue, which could cause a jam.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen refers to 13 items, so the question is whether 13 Mac Trucks, placed side by side, would cause a jam on the Golden Gate Bridge. The Golden Gate Bridge has a total width of about 90 feet, with four lanes (two in each direction) each approximately 12 feet wide. A Mac Truck is typically around 11 feet wide. \n\nIf placed side by side, 13 Mac Trucks would require 143 feet of width, which exceeds the bridge's total width of 90 feet. This means they cannot all fit side by side on the bridge. As a result, the trucks would have to queue up, potentially causing a traffic jam, especially if they are entering the bridge simultaneously. Therefore, the physical constraints of the bridge's width make it impossible for all 13 trucks to be on the bridge at once, leading to congestion.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",
    "full_cot": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty long and wide.\n\nNext, I should consider the size of the Golden Gate Bridge. I remember it's a suspension bridge in San Francisco, pretty famous. I think it's about 8,000 feet long, but I'm not entirely sure. The main span is around 4,200 feet, but the total length including the approaches is longer. Anyway, the bridge has two main lanes in each direction, I believe, so four lanes total. Each lane is wide enough for cars, but how wide is that exactly? Maybe 12 feet per lane? I'm not certain, but that's a common width for highways.\n\nNow, if we have 13 Mac Trucks, each probably around 15-20 feet in length, how much space would they take up side by side? If each is about 15 feet long, 13 of them would be 195 feet long. But wait, the question is about them being side by side, not one after the other. So, how wide is each Mac Truck? I think they're about 8-10 feet wide. So, 13 of them side by side would take up 130 feet in width. \n\nBut the bridge's lanes are only 12 feet wide each, and there are four lanes. So, four lanes would give a total width of 48 feet. If the trucks are 130 feet wide when placed side by side, that's way wider than the bridge's total width. That doesn't make sense because the bridge isn't that wide. So, maybe the trucks can't even fit side by side across all four lanes.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the question is about 13 Mac Trucks trying to cross the bridge at the same time, each taking up a lane. If each lane is 12 feet wide, and each truck is, say, 10 feet wide, then 13 trucks would require 130 feet of lane space. But each lane is only 12 feet wide. So, they can't fit side by side across the lanes. They would have to go one after the other, not side by side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the length of the trucks blocking the bridge. If each truck is 15 feet long, 13 of them in a line would be 195 feet. The bridge's total length is about 8,000 feet, so 195 feet is a small fraction. But traffic can move, so unless there's a bottleneck, maybe it wouldn't jam up. But if all 13 trucks are trying to enter the bridge at the same point, that could cause a traffic jam because they can't all fit on the bridge at once.\n\nAnother angle: the Golden Gate Bridge's traffic capacity. How many vehicles can it handle at a time? I think it's designed to handle a certain number of vehicles without congestion, but 13 trucks might not be enough to cause a jam. However, if all 13 trucks are entering the bridge at the same time, maybe in the same direction, they could block the on-ramp or cause a pile-up.\n\nWait, but the bridge has multiple lanes and traffic lights. So, maybe the traffic would flow as usual, and the 13 trucks wouldn't cause a jam. Or perhaps the question is more about the physical space: can 13 Mac Trucks fit side by side on the bridge? Since the bridge's lanes are only 12 feet wide each, and the trucks are wider than that, they wouldn't fit side by side across the lanes. So, they'd have to go one after the other, which would take up more space but not necessarily cause a jam unless there's a sudden stoppage.\n\nI'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the exact dimensions. The Golden Gate Bridge has a total width of about 90 feet, including the sidewalks and lanes. Each traffic lane is about 12 feet wide, with two lanes in each direction. So, four lanes in total, each 12 feet wide. A Mac Truck is about 11 feet wide. So, if you have 13 trucks, each 11 feet wide, side by side, that's 143 feet. The bridge's total width is 90 feet, so that's way wider than the bridge. Therefore, you can't fit 13 Mac Trucks side by side on the bridge because the bridge isn't that wide.\n\nWait, but the question is about them jamming up the bridge. So, if 13 trucks tried to enter the bridge at the same time, they would have to queue up, which could cause a traffic jam on the approach, but not necessarily on the bridge itself. The bridge's capacity is about how many vehicles can pass per hour, but 13 trucks at once might not exceed that.

I remember it's about 1.7 miles long, but that includes the entire bridge, including the cables and the towers. The actual road part is about 1.5 miles across. The bridge has two main lanes for traffic, I believe, each lane being wide enough for cars and trucks.\n\nWait, no, actually, the Golden Gate Bridge has six lanes in total, divided into two sections: four lanes for vehicles and two lanes for pedestrians and bicycles. So, for vehicles, it's four lanes. Each lane is probably wide enough to accommodate trucks, but how much space do Mac Trucks take up?\n\nMac Trucks are pretty long and wide. I think they're about 11 feet wide and maybe 20 feet long. If you have 13 of them side by side, that's 13 times 11 feet, which is 143 feet wide. But the bridge's lanes are only so wide. Let me check the width of the Golden Gate Bridge's vehicle lanes. I think each lane is about 12 feet wide. So, four lanes would be 48 feet wide total.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 13 Mac Trucks at 11 feet each would require 143 feet, but the bridge's total width for vehicle lanes is only 48 feet. That doesn't make sense because 143 feet is way wider than 48 feet. So, even if you had all four lanes filled with Mac Trucks, that's 48 feet, but 13 trucks would take up 143 feet, which is impossible because the bridge isn't that wide.\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the question is about whether 13 Mac Trucks, each taking up a lane, would block the bridge. Since there are four lanes, 13 trucks would mean more than three per lane on average. But each lane is 12 feet wide, so a Mac Truck is 11 feet wide, so each lane can fit one Mac Truck with a little space left. If you have four lanes, you can fit four Mac Trucks without any issue. But 13 is way more than four. So, they would have to go side by side across multiple lanes, which isn't possible because the bridge's lanes are fixed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the height. Mac Trucks are tall, and the Golden Gate Bridge has a clearance height. I think the bridge's vertical clearance is about 750 feet at the center, but that's for ships. For vehicles, the clearance is lower, maybe around 16 feet. Mac Trucks are about 13.5 feet tall, so they should be able to pass under the bridge without a problem.\n\nBut the main issue is the width. The bridge's vehicle lanes are only 48 feet wide in total. If you have 13 Mac Trucks, each 11 feet wide, lined up side by side, that would require 143 feet of width, which is way beyond the bridge's capacity. So, it's physically impossible for 13 Mac Trucks to be side by side on the Golden Gate Bridge because there's not enough space.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is more about traffic congestion. If 13 Mac Trucks were on the bridge at the same time, would that cause a jam? The bridge has four vehicle lanes, so 13 trucks would mean more than three per lane. That could cause congestion because each lane can only handle so many vehicles at once. But I'm not sure if 13 is enough to cause a complete jam. It depends on how the traffic is moving.\n\nBut considering the physical space, the main issue is the width. Since the bridge's lanes aren't wide enough to fit 13 trucks side by side, it's impossible for them to be on the bridge at the same time in that configuration.

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable.\n\nNow, the Golden Gate Bridge is a famous suspension bridge in San Francisco. It's pretty long, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact dimensions. I remember it's about 1.7 miles long, but that includes the entire bridge, including the cables and the towers. The actual road part is about 1.5 miles across. The bridge has two main lanes for traffic, I believe, each lane being wide enough for cars and trucks.\n\nWait, no, actually, the Golden Gate Bridge has six lanes in total, divided into two sections: four lanes for vehicles and two lanes for pedestrians and bicycles. So, for vehicles, it's four lanes. Each lane is probably wide enough to accommodate trucks, but how much space do Mac Trucks take up?\n\nMac Trucks are pretty long and wide. I think they're about 11 feet wide and maybe 20 feet long. If you have 13 of them side by side, that's 13 times 11 feet, which is 143 feet wide. But the bridge's lanes are only so wide. Let me check the width of the Golden Gate Bridge's vehicle lanes. I think each lane is about 12 feet wide. So, four lanes would be 48 feet wide total.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 13 Mac Trucks at 11 feet each would require 143 feet, but the bridge's total width for vehicle lanes is only 48 feet. That doesn't make sense because 143 feet is way wider than 48 feet. So, even if you had all four lanes filled with Mac Trucks, that's 48 feet, but 13 trucks would take up 143 feet, which is impossible because the bridge isn't that wide.\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the question is about whether 13 Mac Trucks, each taking up a lane, would block the bridge. Since there are four lanes, 13 trucks would mean more than three per lane on average. But each lane is 12 feet wide, so a Mac Truck is 11 feet wide, so each lane can fit one Mac Truck with a little space left. If you have four lanes, you can fit four Mac Trucks without any issue. But 13 is way more than four. So, they would have to go side by side across multiple lanes, which isn't possible because the bridge's lanes are fixed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the height. Mac Trucks are tall, and the Golden Gate Bridge has a clearance height. I think the bridge's vertical clearance is about 750 feet at the center, but that's for ships. For vehicles, the clearance is lower, maybe around 16 feet. Mac Trucks are about 13.5 feet tall, so they should be able to pass under the bridge without a problem.\n\nBut the main issue is the width. The bridge's vehicle lanes are only 48 feet wide in total. If you have 13 Mac Trucks, each 11 feet wide, lined up side by side, that would require 143 feet of width, which is way beyond the bridge's capacity. So, it's physically impossible for 13 Mac Trucks to be side by side on the Golden Gate Bridge because there's not enough space.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is more about traffic congestion. If 13 Mac Trucks were on the bridge at the same time, would that cause a jam? The bridge has four vehicle lanes, so 13 trucks would mean more than three per lane. That could cause congestion because each lane can only handle so many vehicles at once. But I'm not sure if 13 is enough to cause a complete jam. It depends on how the traffic is moving.\n\nBut considering the physical space, the main issue is the width. Since the bridge's lanes aren't wide enough to fit 13 trucks side by side, it's impossible for them to be on the bridge at the same time in that configuration. Therefore, the answer would be no, they wouldn't jam up the bridge because you can't fit that many side by side.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen refers to 13 items. Mac Trucks are large vehicles, each approximately 11 feet wide. The Golden Gate Bridge has four vehicle lanes, totaling about 48 feet in width. To fit 13 Mac Trucks side by side would require 143 feet of width, which exceeds the bridge's 48-foot width. Therefore, it's physically impossible for 13 Mac Trucks to be side by side on the Golden Gate Bridge. \n\nAdditionally, while traffic congestion could occur with multiple trucks, the primary limitation is the bridge's physical width, making it impossible for 13 Mac Trucks to be on the bridge simultaneously in such a configuration. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",

It's pretty narrow compared to modern bridges. I've heard that it has two main lanes, one in each direction. Wait, no, actually, I think it's divided into two separate sections, each with two lanes. So each side has two lanes, making a total of four lanes. That means each lane is probably about 12 feet wide, which is standard for highway lanes.\n\nNow, how long is a Mac Truck? I think the standard Mac Truck is around 14 feet long, not counting the trailer. But if you include the trailer, it can be much longer, maybe up to 50 feet or more. But since the question is about the trucks themselves, I'll focus on the truck without the trailer, so about 14 feet each.\n\nIf we have 13 of these trucks side by side, how much space would they take? Each is about 14 feet long, so 13 times 14 is 182 feet. But wait, that's the length if they are placed end to end. But the question says side by side, which I think refers to their width, not length. So actually, we're considering their width across the bridge.\n\nEach lane is about 12 feet wide. If the trucks are side by side, how many can fit in a single lane? Let's see, 12 feet divided by the width of each truck. Wait, how wide is a Mac Truck? I think they're about 8 feet wide, including mirrors. So, in a 12-foot lane, you can fit maybe one and a half trucks. But since you can't have half a truck, practically, one truck per lane.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. If the trucks are placed side by side across the bridge, meaning their widths are aligned along the direction of the bridge. So, if the bridge is 12 feet wide per lane, and each truck is 8 feet wide, then in one lane, you can fit 12 / 8 = 1.5 trucks. But since you can't split a truck, only one truck per lane.\n\nBut the bridge has four lanes, so in each direction, two lanes. So, in each lane, you can have one truck side by side. So, in four lanes, you can have four trucks. But the question is about 13 trucks. That's way more than four.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. The Golden Gate Bridge's total width is about 90 feet, including the two sidewalks. But the main road is four lanes, each 12 feet wide, so 48 feet for the road. The total width of the bridge is 90 feet, so the road takes up 48, leaving 42 feet for sidewalks and other structures.\n\nIf the trucks are side by side across the entire bridge, how many can fit? Let's see, the road is 48 feet wide. Each truck is about 8 feet wide. So 48 / 8 = 6 trucks. So, only 6 trucks could fit side by side on the road part of the bridge.\n\nBut the question is about a baker's dozen, which is 13. That's way more than 6. So even if you include the sidewalks, which are 12 feet each, adding 24 feet to the 48 feet road, making 72 feet. 72 / 8 = 9. So maybe 9 trucks could fit if you include the sidewalks.

If the entire 13 trucks are trying to enter the bridge at once, their combined width exceeds the bridge's width, leading to a situation where they can't all get on the bridge, causing a backup on the land side. But the bridge itself might not be physically blocked because only a few can be on it at a time. However, the question is about the bridge being jammed, so maybe it refers to the bridge's capacity rather than the physical width.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is more about whether the number of trucks would cause congestion or blockage on the bridge. If the bridge can handle multiple lanes, perhaps 13 trucks in a single lane wouldn't cause a jam, but if they're spread across all lanes, it might.\n\nI think the key point is that the Golden Gate Bridge's width is insufficient to accommodate 13 side-by-side Mac Trucks. Therefore, they would not all fit on the bridge simultaneously, leading to a situation where the bridge becomes congested as the trucks try to move across one after another, potentially causing a jam.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is approximately 90 feet wide, while a standard Mac Truck is about 8.5 feet wide. A baker's dozen consists of 13 trucks. If these 13 trucks were arranged side by side, they would require a total width of 110.5 feet, which exceeds the bridge's width. Therefore, all 13 trucks cannot fit on the bridge simultaneously, leading to congestion as they attempt to cross one after another. This would likely cause a traffic jam on the bridge.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

I should double-check that.\n\nNow, how long is a Mac Truck? Mac Trucks are typically around 19 feet long, but when you add a trailer, they can be much longer. Wait, the question says \"side by side,\" so maybe we're just talking about the truck without the trailer? Or does it include the trailer? That could make a big difference. Let's assume each Mac Truck is about 20 feet long without the trailer. If they're side by side, 13 of them would take up 13 times 20 feet, which is 260 feet.

I remember reading that the bridge has two main lanes, each about 11 feet wide, but I'm not entirely sure. So, if each lane is 11 feet, then two lanes would be about 22 feet wide. But wait, maybe that's the total width including shoulders and such. I should double-check that.\n\nNow, how long is a Mac Truck? Mac Trucks are typically around 19 feet long, but when you add a trailer, they can be much longer. Wait, the question says \"side by side,\" so maybe we're just talking about the truck without the trailer? Or does it include the trailer? That could make a big difference. Let's assume each Mac Truck is about 20 feet long without the trailer. If they're side by side, 13 of them would take up 13 times 20 feet, which is 260 feet. But the bridge is only about 8,981 feet long, so that's not the issue. The problem is the width.\n\nIf the bridge's lanes are 11 feet each, and the Mac Trucks are, say, 8 feet wide each, then 13 of them side by side would be 13 times 8, which is 104 feet wide. But the bridge's lanes are only 11 feet wide. Wait, that can't be right. That would mean the trucks are way wider than the bridge's lanes. So even one Mac Truck wouldn't fit side by side in a single lane.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. If the question is about 13 Mac Trucks being placed side by side across the entire bridge, but the bridge is only two lanes wide, each about 11 feet. So 13 trucks, each needing their own lane, but the bridge only has two lanes. That wouldn't work because you can't have 13 lanes. So even one truck would take up the entire lane, and having 13 of them side by side isn't possible on the bridge's width.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the length of the bridge. If the bridge is 8,981 feet long and each Mac Truck is, say, 20 feet long, then 13 trucks would take up 260 feet. That's much less than the total length, so they wouldn't block the entire bridge. But the issue is the width. The bridge's lanes are too narrow for 13 trucks to be side by side.\n\nSo, putting it all together, a baker's dozen (13) of Mac Trucks placed side by side would require a much wider space than the Golden Gate Bridge's lanes provide. Therefore, they would indeed jam up the bridge because you can't fit 13 trucks side by side in the two existing lanes.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge has two lanes, each approximately 11 feet wide. A baker's dozen consists of 13 Mac Trucks, each about 8 feet wide. Placing 13 trucks side by side would require a width of 104 feet, which far exceeds the bridge's lane width. Therefore, they would jam up the bridge.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

However, even if each truck is 8 feet and spaced 2 feet apart, 13 trucks would take up 13*(8+2) = 130 feet. The bridge's total width is about 90 feet, so that wouldn't fit.\n\nAlso, traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge is usually pretty heavy, especially during rush hours. If you have 13 large trucks trying to cross at the same time, they might block the bridge even if they fit.

I know it's pretty long, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact measurements. I should look up the length of the bridge. Wait, from what I remember, the Golden Gate Bridge is about 8,981 feet long, which is roughly 1.7 miles. But bridges have different sections\u2014like the main span and the approaches.

Mac Trucks are big, but let's estimate their length. A standard Mac Truck, like a refuse truck, is probably around 25-30 feet long. So if each truck is about 25 feet long, 13 of them would take up 13 * 25 = 325 feet. But they are side by side, so the width would be the same as the bridge's lane width.

But the bridge's total width is 120 feet, right? So 104 feet is less than 120 feet. So in terms of width, they might fit, but what about the length? The bridge is about 8,981 feet long, but the trucks are only 325 feet long in total. So 325 feet is much shorter than the entire bridge length.\n\nWait, but the bridge has curves and specific clearances. Maybe the trucks can't all fit in a straight line because of the bridge's structure. Also, the Golden Gate Bridge has a clearance height and width that must be considered. If the trucks are too tall or wide, they might not be able to pass. But I'm assuming they're standard Mac Trucks, which are built to navigate the bridge.\n\nAnother point is traffic flow. The Golden Gate Bridge handles a lot of traffic daily. If 13 trucks are moving side by side, even if they fit in terms of space, the traffic might get backed up because they're all trying to move through the same area at the same time. But the question is whether they would \"jam up\" the bridge, meaning cause a blockage or congestion.\n\nBut considering that the bridge is 1.7 miles long, and the trucks only take up 325 feet, which is about 1/14th of the bridge's length, it's unlikely they'd block the entire bridge.

I know it's a famous suspension bridge in San Francisco, connecting the Golden Gate Strait to the Bay Area. It's pretty narrow compared to modern bridges, I believe. I've heard that it has two main lanes in each direction, making four total lanes. The bridge is also quite old, so maybe the lanes aren't as wide as newer bridges.\n\nNow, would 13 Mac Trucks, placed side by side, fit on the bridge without causing a jam? Well, first, I should consider the width. Each lane on the Golden Gate Bridge is probably about 12 feet wide, maybe a bit more. Let me check, actually, I think each lane is 12 feet wide. So, four lanes would be 48 feet wide. But wait, the bridge might have some shoulders or barriers between lanes, so the actual driving area might be less.\n\nMac Trucks are pretty long, maybe around 50-60 feet each, but when considering their width, I think they're about 8-10 feet wide. So, if each truck is 10 feet wide, 13 of them side by side would be 130 feet wide. That's way wider than the bridge's total width of 80 feet (40 feet for two lanes, but I'm not sure). Wait, maybe I'm confusing the total width with the clear span. The Golden Gate Bridge's main span is about 4200 feet, but the width is different.\n\nWait, let me get accurate numbers. The Golden Gate Bridge has a total width of about 90 feet, including the two main traffic lanes (each 12 feet wide) and the shoulders and barriers. So, if each lane is 12 feet, two lanes would be 24 feet. Then, adding shoulders and barriers, maybe up to 90 feet total. But the actual driving lanes are 24 feet for two lanes.\n\nSo, if each Mac Truck is 10 feet wide, 13 of them side by side would require 130 feet of width. The bridge's total width is about 90 feet, so even if you ignore the barriers and just have the trucks, they wouldn't fit. Plus, the bridge's lanes are only 12 feet wide each, so even a single truck might not fit without some adjustments.\n\nWait, but Mac Trucks are heavy and long, but their width is a factor. If each lane is 12 feet, and the truck is 10 feet wide, that's almost the full width. So, even one truck would take up the entire lane, and you can't have another truck next to it. So, 13 trucks side by side would need 13 times 10 feet, which is 130 feet. The bridge's total width is only about 90 feet, so they wouldn't fit.\n\nMoreover, the Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge, and it's designed for cars and maybe some trucks, but having 13 trucks side by side would not only be physically impossible but also a safety hazard. It would definitely cause a jam because you can't have that many vehicles taking up the entire bridge at once.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is no, a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks wouldn't fit on the Golden Gate Bridge without jamming because the bridge is too narrow for that many trucks side by side.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge has a total width of about 90 feet, including two 12-foot-wide traffic lanes and additional shoulders and barriers.

I've heard that it has two main lanes in each direction, making four total lanes. The bridge is also quite old, so maybe the lanes aren't as wide as newer bridges.\n\nNow, would 13 Mac Trucks, placed side by side, fit on the bridge without causing a jam? Well, first, I should consider the width. Each lane on the Golden Gate Bridge is probably about 12 feet wide, maybe a bit more. Let me check, actually, I think each lane is 12 feet wide. So, four lanes would be 48 feet wide. But wait, the bridge might have some shoulders or barriers between lanes, so the actual driving area might be less.\n\nMac Trucks are pretty long, maybe around 50-60 feet each, but when considering their width, I think they're about 8-10 feet wide. So, if each truck is 10 feet wide, 13 of them side by side would be 130 feet wide. That's way wider than the bridge's total width of 80 feet (40 feet for two lanes, but I'm not sure). Wait, maybe I'm confusing the total width with the clear span. The Golden Gate Bridge's main span is about 4200 feet, but the width is different.\n\nWait, let me get accurate numbers. The Golden Gate Bridge has a total width of about 90 feet, including the two main traffic lanes (each 12 feet wide) and the shoulders and barriers. So, if each lane is 12 feet, two lanes would be 24 feet. Then, adding shoulders and barriers, maybe up to 90 feet total. But the actual driving lanes are 24 feet for two lanes.\n\nSo, if each Mac Truck is 10 feet wide, 13 of them side by side would require 130 feet of width. The bridge's total width is about 90 feet, so even if you ignore the barriers and just have the trucks, they wouldn't fit. Plus, the bridge's lanes are only 12 feet wide each, so even a single truck might not fit without some adjustments.\n\nWait, but Mac Trucks are heavy and long, but their width is a factor. If each lane is 12 feet, and the truck is 10 feet wide, that's almost the full width. So, even one truck would take up the entire lane, and you can't have another truck next to it. So, 13 trucks side by side would need 13 times 10 feet, which is 130 feet. The bridge's total width is only about 90 feet, so they wouldn't fit.\n\nMoreover, the Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge, and it's designed for cars and maybe some trucks, but having 13 trucks side by side would not only be physically impossible but also a safety hazard. It would definitely cause a jam because you can't have that many vehicles taking up the entire bridge at once.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is no, a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks wouldn't fit on the Golden Gate Bridge without jamming because the bridge is too narrow for that many trucks side by side.\n</think>\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge has a total width of about 90 feet, including two 12-foot-wide traffic lanes and additional shoulders and barriers. A baker's dozen of Mac Trucks, each approximately 10 feet wide, would require 130 feet of space side by side, which exceeds the bridge's width. Even one truck would nearly fill a lane, making it impossible to fit 13 trucks without causing a jam. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

Question: Would baker's dozen of side by side Mac Trucks jam up Golden Gate Bridge?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a baker's dozen of side-by-side Mac Trucks would jam up the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's break this down step by step. First, what's a baker's dozen? I think it's 13 items. So, 13 Mac Trucks. Mac Trucks are those big, heavy-duty trucks made by the company Mac, right? They're pretty sizable.\n\nNext, the Golden Gate Bridge. I know it's a famous suspension bridge in San Francisco. It's pretty long, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact measurements. I think it's about 1.7 miles long, but I might be mixing it up with other bridges. Anyway, the bridge has multiple lanes, I believe four or more, for both directions.\n\nNow, each Mac Truck is quite large. If they're side by side, how much space would 13 of them take up? Let's assume each truck is about 10 feet wide. That would make the total width 130 feet. But wait, bridges have fixed widths based on the number of lanes. If the Golden Gate Bridge has, say, four lanes, each lane is probably around 12 feet wide. So four lanes would be 48 feet wide. If 13 trucks are side by side, that's 130 feet, which is way wider than the bridge's total width of 48 feet. That seems impossible because the trucks can't be wider than the bridge itself.\n\nBut maybe I'm miscalculating. Perhaps the trucks are not all in a single line but spread across the lanes. If the bridge has multiple lanes, maybe the trucks can be arranged across them. Let's say the bridge has four lanes. If each lane can fit a certain number of trucks, then 13 trucks might fit without causing a jam. But I'm not sure how many trucks can fit in each lane. Also, traffic flow is another factor. If the trucks are moving, would 13 of them cause a backup?\n\nAnother angle: the Golden Gate Bridge is a major thoroughfare for vehicles. It's designed to handle a certain amount of traffic. If 13 trucks are on the bridge at the same time, would that exceed the capacity? I think the bridge can handle a lot more than that, considering the number of cars and trucks that cross daily. So maybe 13 isn't enough to cause a jam.\n\nWait, but if all 13 trucks are parked or stopped on the bridge at once, that could block traffic. But normally, traffic moves, so unless there's an accident or a stoppage, the trucks would keep moving. Also, the question doesn't specify if they're moving or stationary.\n\nI'm a bit confused.

Let me think\u2014Golden Gate Bridge's total width is about 90 feet for the road, plus 20 feet for the sidewalks. So total width is 130 feet. Hmm, 13 trucks at 12 feet each would take up 156 feet, which is wider than the bridge itself. That doesn't make sense because the bridge isn't that wide.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's think again. The bridge's total width is about 133 feet, including the two main roadways and the walkways. Each traffic lane is about 12 feet wide. So, if there are multiple lanes, maybe the bridge can handle several trucks side by side without blocking. But 13 is a lot. If the bridge has, say, 8 lanes, each lane can fit one truck. So 8 trucks could fit, but 13 would require more lanes than available. That would mean the trucks would have to be placed side by side across the entire width of the bridge, which is only about 130 feet. So 13 trucks at 12 feet each would take up 156 feet, which is wider than the bridge's total width. Therefore, they wouldn't fit side by side on the bridge without overlapping.\n\nAnother angle: the bridge's design. It's a suspension bridge, so it's designed to handle traffic moving in both directions. If all 13 trucks were on the bridge at the same time, side by side, it might cause congestion because there's not enough space for that many vehicles. But realistically, traffic is managed with lanes and signals, so you wouldn't have 13 trucks trying to occupy the bridge simultaneously. However, the question is about whether they would jam up the bridge if placed side by side, regardless of traffic flow. So purely in terms of physical space, 13 trucks would require more width than the bridge provides.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The bridge's total width is about 133 feet, as I thought. If each truck is 12 feet wide, 13 trucks would take up 156 feet. Since 156 is more than 133, they wouldn't fit. So the answer is no, they wouldn't fit because the bridge isn't wide enough.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen consists of 13 items, so 13 Mac Trucks would be placed side by side. Each Mac Truck is approximately 12 feet wide, totaling 156 feet for 13 trucks. The Golden Gate Bridge has a total width of about 133 feet, which is insufficient to accommodate 13 trucks side by side. Therefore, they would not fit on the bridge without overlapping. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",

The total length is longer, but the main span is the key part here. The bridge has two main lanes, I believe, each about 12 feet wide. So, two lanes in total, each 12 feet, making 24 feet for both.\n\nNow, how wide is a Mac Truck? I'm not exactly sure, but I think a standard semi-truck trailer is about 8.5 feet wide. If it's a Mac Truck, maybe a bit wider, but let's estimate around 9 feet each for safety. If each truck is 9 feet wide and they're placed side by side, 13 of them would take up 13 * 9 = 117 feet. \n\nWait, that's way more than the 24 feet available on the bridge. So, 117 feet versus 24 feet. That's almost five times wider. But bridges have roadways wider than the main span, right? Maybe the actual bridge's deck is wider. Let me think. The Golden Gate Bridge's road deck is about 62 feet wide, including the shoulders and all. So, 62 feet is the total width available for traffic.\n\nIf each Mac Truck is 9 feet wide, 13 of them would take up 117 feet, which is still more than the 62 feet available. That means they wouldn't fit side by side on the bridge's deck. So, even if they tried to line them up, they wouldn't all fit at once. Plus, the bridge has multiple lanes, but I think it's only two main lanes for vehicles, each 12 feet wide.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the height and length of the trucks. The Golden Gate Bridge has clearance for vehicles, but Mac Trucks are quite tall. The vertical clearance under the bridge is around 790 feet at the center, but that's for ships. For vehicles, the clearance is about 13 feet. Mac Trucks are about 13.5 feet tall, so they'd just barely fit under the bridge, but not much room to spare. If the trucks are tall, they might block traffic behind them or cause congestion.\n\nAlso, the length of the bridge is another factor. The main span is 4,200 feet, but the total length is longer. If 13 trucks are moving across, they'd take up a significant length of the bridge, potentially causing a backup as they move across.\n\nMoreover, the number of lanes on the Golden Gate Bridge is two, each 12 feet wide. So, even if the trucks are 9 feet wide, two trucks would take up 18 feet, leaving some space, but 13 trucks would require 117 feet, which is way beyond the bridge's capacity. So, it's impossible to fit 13 side-by-side Mac Trucks on the bridge's lanes.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the width of the bridge's lanes and the size of the trucks, a baker's dozen of Mac Trucks would not fit side by side on the Golden Gate Bridge.

From what I remember, the Golden Gate Bridge is about 1,970 meters long and around 64 meters wide.

Even with 12 lanes, during rush hours, it can get really crowded. If you have 13 Mac Trucks taking up a significant portion of the bridge's width, it might cause a bottleneck. But I'm not sure if 13 trucks would completely block all lanes. Maybe they would cause a significant slowdown, but would they \"jam up\" the bridge entirely?\n\nAlso, considering that each Mac Truck is longer than a standard car, the length of the trucks might affect how they move across the bridge. If they're all moving at the same time, they might take up more space and slow down traffic. But would 13 of them cause a complete jam? Or would traffic just slow down significantly?\n\nI'm leaning towards yes because the combined width of 13 Mac Trucks is almost as wide as the entire bridge's vehicle lanes. Even if there are 12 lanes, the trucks being side by side would take up most of the available space, leaving little room for other vehicles. This could cause a significant bottleneck, leading to a jam-up on the bridge.\n</think>\n\nA baker's dozen consists of 13 items, so 13 Mac Trucks would be side by side. Each Mac Truck is wide, likely around 10 feet, making the total width 130 feet. The Golden Gate Bridge has 12 lanes, totaling 144 feet, but practical factors like barriers and shoulders reduce usable width. The 13 trucks would occupy most of the bridge's width, causing a significant bottleneck and likely jamming up traffic.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

That's way more than the 70 feet width of the bridge. But wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check the actual width of a Mac Truck. I think a standard semi-truck trailer is about 8.5 feet wide.

So, even if the trucks are 13, they can't fit into the 48 feet of traffic lanes because 13 times 8.5 is 110.5, which is way more than 48.
