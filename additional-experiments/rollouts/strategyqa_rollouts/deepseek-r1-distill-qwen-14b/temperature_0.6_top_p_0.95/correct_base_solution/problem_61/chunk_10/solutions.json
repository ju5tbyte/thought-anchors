Question: Is the best tasting part of the papaya in the center?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the best tasting part of a papaya is in the center. Let me think about this step by step. First, I know that papayas are tropical fruits, and I've eaten them before. When I eat a papaya, I usually cut it in half and scoop out the seeds in the middle. The part I eat is the orange flesh around the seeds. But wait, is that the center? Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the terms. I remember that the center part of the papaya has the seeds. Those seeds are small, black, and sometimes people don't like them because they can be a bit bitter or have a weird texture. So if the center has the seeds, and they're not the best part, maybe the best part isn't in the center. Instead, it's the outer orange flesh that's sweet and juicy. So the best tasting part is actually the surrounding flesh, not the center where the seeds are. Therefore, the answer should be no, the best part isn't in the center.\n</think>\n\nThe best tasting part of the papaya is the orange flesh surrounding the seeds, which are located in the center. The seeds are not typically eaten due to their bitter taste and texture. Therefore, the best part is not in the center. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",

I've also heard that some people don't eat the skin because it's not tasty, so the edible part is the orange flesh.
