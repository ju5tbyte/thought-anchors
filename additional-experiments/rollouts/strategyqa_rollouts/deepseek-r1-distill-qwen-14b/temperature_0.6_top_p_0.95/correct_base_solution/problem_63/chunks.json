  "source_text": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Is double duty an incorrect phrase for host of Dancing With The Stars?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if \"double duty\" is an incorrect phrase for the host of Dancing With The Stars. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. The user is wondering whether using \"double duty\" to describe the host's role is wrong. \n\nFirst, I should think about what \"double duty\" means. From what I know, \"double duty\" usually refers to doing two jobs or responsibilities at the same time. So, if someone is doing double duty, they're handling two tasks or roles simultaneously.\n\nNow, considering the host of Dancing With The Stars. The show has a host who primarily presents the show, introduces acts, interacts with contestants, and so on. I don't think the host typically has another role during the show itself. They're just the host. So, if someone says the host is doing double duty, they might be implying that the host is also performing or doing something else besides hosting. \n\nWait, but in some cases, maybe the host has another role, like maybe they're also a judge or something. But I don't recall that being the case. The host's main role is to host, not to judge or perform. So, if someone says the host is doing double duty, they might be mistaken because the host isn't doing two jobs during the show.\n\nI should also think about how the phrase is used in general. \"Double duty\" can sometimes be used metaphorically, but in this context, it's probably meant literally. So, if the host isn't doing two things at once, then using \"double duty\" would be incorrect.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the host has other commitments outside the show, like other jobs or projects, but that's separate from their role during the show itself. So, during the show, they're just hosting, not doing anything else. Therefore, \"double duty\" in that specific context would be incorrect.\n\nI think I've got it. The phrase \"double duty\" would be incorrect because the host isn't handling two roles during the show. They're just the host, so the term doesn't apply correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe phrase \"double duty\" implies performing two roles simultaneously. In the context of the host of *Dancing With The Stars*, the host's primary role is to present the show without typically engaging in another task during it. Therefore, describing the host as doing \"double duty\" would be incorrect, as they are not handling two responsibilities at once. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",
