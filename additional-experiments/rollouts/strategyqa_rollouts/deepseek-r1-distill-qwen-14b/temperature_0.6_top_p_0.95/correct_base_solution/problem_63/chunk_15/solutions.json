Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. The user is wondering whether using \"double duty\" to describe the host's role is wrong. First, I should think about what \"double duty\" means. From what I know, \"double duty\" usually refers to doing two jobs or responsibilities at the same time. So, if someone is doing double duty, they're handling two tasks or roles simultaneously. Now, considering the host of Dancing With The Stars. The show has a host who primarily presents the show, introduces acts, interacts with contestants, and so on. I don't think the host typically has another role during the show itself. They're just the host. So, if someone says the host is doing double duty, they might be implying that the host is also performing or doing something else besides hosting. Wait, but in some cases, maybe the host has another role, like maybe they're also a judge or something. But I don't recall that being the case. The host's main role is to host, not to judge or perform. So, if someone says the host is doing double duty, they might be mistaken because the host isn't doing two jobs during the show. Therefore, using \"double duty\" in that context might be incorrect because it's not accurate to say the host is handling two roles. Instead, \"double duty\" would be correct if, for example, the host was also a contestant or had another official role during the show, but I don't think that's the case. So, the phrase \"double duty\" would be incorrect for the host of Dancing With The Stars because it inaccurately implies the host has another role besides hosting. \n</think>\n\nThe phrase \"double duty\" implies the host has two roles simultaneously, which isn't the case for Dancing With The Stars hosts. They primarily host and don't perform another official role during the show. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",
