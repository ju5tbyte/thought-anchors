Also, he was a banker, which might mean he worked in an office environment, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. I think about his lifespan. He was born in 1837 and died in 1913. That's a pretty long life, especially for that era, so maybe he was generally healthy. But I also remember that many wealthy people in that time had access to better medical care, so maybe he could manage any health issues he had. On the other hand, if he had any chronic conditions like lung disease, it might have been harder to treat back then. I should check if there are any historical records or biographies that mention his health. I think I've heard that he had some health problems later in life, possibly related to his heart or other organs, but I'm not certain about his lungs specifically. Maybe he smoked, which could have affected his lung health, but I'm not sure if he did. Alternatively, living in a city like New York during his time, with horse-drawn carriages and coal fires, could have exposed him to a lot of pollutants, which might have impacted his lungs.

He was a famous banker and financier in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was involved in a lot of big businesses and was a major figure in American finance. Now, the question is about his lung health. I don't remember any specific information about his health issues, but I do know that he lived during a time when air pollution was probably worse than it is now. Also, he was a banker, which might mean he worked in an office environment, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. I think about his lifespan. He was born in 1837 and died in 1913. That's a pretty long life, especially for that era, so maybe he was generally healthy. But I also remember that many wealthy people in that time had access to better medical care, so maybe he could manage any health issues he had. I'm trying to recall if there are any historical records or biographies that mention his health. I think some sources say he had a robust constitution, but I'm not certain about his lungs specifically. Maybe he smoked? I'm not sure. If he did smoke, that could have affected his lung health. On the other hand, if he didn't smoke and had no known respiratory illnesses, he might have had healthy lungs. I'm leaning towards yes, but I'm not entirely confident. I should check if there are any specific mentions of his lung health. From what I can find quickly, there's no prominent information about him having lung problems.
