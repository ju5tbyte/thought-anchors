  "source_text": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Would a psychic who admits to hot reading be trustworthy?\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a psychic who admits to hot reading would be trustworthy. First, I need to understand what hot reading is. From what I know, hot reading is a technique where a psychic gets information about a person before the session, often through things like the internet, social media, or other publicly available sources. They use this information to make accurate statements during the reading, which can make it seem like they have genuine psychic abilities.\n\nNow, the question is about trustworthiness. If a psychic admits to using hot reading, does that make them trustworthy or not? Well, on one hand, they're being honest about their method. That's a positive because honesty is usually a key component of trust. If someone is upfront about how they operate, it can build credibility.\n\nBut then, I have to think about what hot reading actually does. It relies on external information rather than genuine psychic insight. So, even though the psychic is honest about their approach, the fact that they're using this method instead of relying on intuition or other psychic methods might raise questions about their authenticity. Some people might feel deceived because they expected a genuine psychic experience, not one based on prior research.\n\nAnother angle is whether the effectiveness of hot reading is reliable. If the psychic is gathering information beforehand, their accuracy could depend on how thorough their research is and how much information they can find on the person. If the person is someone with a lot of public information available, the psychic might do well. But for someone with minimal online presence, the reading might not be as accurate, making the whole experience seem less trustworthy.\n\nI also wonder about the ethical implications. Is hot reading considered unethical? Some might argue that it's a form of deception because the client might believe the psychic is using genuine paranormal abilities. Others might see it as a clever use of available information and not necessarily unethical, especially if the psychic is upfront about it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the psychic is trustworthy in terms of honesty because they admit to using hot reading. However, their methods might not align with what clients expect from a psychic, which could affect their perceived trustworthiness. It's a bit of a paradox: honesty is good, but the method itself might not meet the client's expectations of what a psychic should do.\n\nI think the key here is whether the client is okay with the method. If they know about hot reading and are fine with it, then the psychic's honesty makes them trustworthy. But if the client expects genuine psychic abilities and the psychic admits to using hot reading, that might undermine trust because the client's expectations aren't being met.\n\nIn conclusion, while the psychic is honest about their approach, which is a positive trait for trustworthiness, the method of hot reading might not satisfy the client's expectations, potentially affecting how trustworthy they feel the psychic is.\n</think>\n\nA psychic who admits to using hot reading is being honest, which is a positive trait for trustworthiness. However, hot reading relies on external information rather than genuine psychic abilities, which might not meet clients' expectations. Therefore, while the honesty is commendable, the method could affect the perceived trustworthiness if clients expect genuine psychic insight. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",
