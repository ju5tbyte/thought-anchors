It's also possible that the psychic's admission could affect their credibility in the eyes of believers who expect psychics to rely solely on paranormal means. Overall, it's a bit of a mixed bag.

If a psychic admits to using hot reading, does that make them trustworthy or not? Well, on one hand, they're being honest about their method. That's a positive because honesty is usually a key component of trust. If someone is upfront about how they work, it can build credibility. On the other hand, hot reading itself might be seen as deceptive because it relies on prior information rather than genuine psychic insight. Even if they're upfront about it, some people might feel that it's not a true psychic gift and therefore question the legitimacy of the readings. Trust also depends on the individual's perspective. Some might appreciate the transparency and the skill involved in using hot reading effectively, while others might feel betrayed if they expected genuine psychic abilities. So, whether the psychic is trustworthy would depend on how the person views hot reading and the importance they place on the method versus the results. If someone values honesty and clear communication about techniques, the psychic might be seen as trustworthy. But if someone expects psychics to use only intuitive methods without prior research, then admitting to hot reading could undermine trust. In the end, trust is a personal judgment call based on individual beliefs and priorities.\n</think>\n\nA psychic who admits to hot reading is being transparent about their method, which can be seen as honest. However, hot reading itself involves using external information rather than genuine psychic abilities, which some may view as deceptive. Trustworthiness in this context depends on individual perceptions\u2014whether honesty about the technique outweighs the reliance on external information. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

If a psychic admits to using hot reading, does that make them trustworthy or not? Well, on one hand, they're being honest about their method. That's a positive because honesty is usually a key component of trust. But on the other hand, hot reading can be seen as deceptive because it gives the illusion of psychic powers without actually using them. Even if they admit to it, some people might feel that it's not a genuine psychic experience. There's also the aspect of how effective the reading is. If the psychic relies on external information, the session might feel more structured around that data rather than providing deeper insights or spiritual guidance. Plus, some people might not care as long as they get accurate information, while others might feel it's not as meaningful. So, considering all this, even though the psychic is honest, the method itself could raise questions about trustworthiness because it's based on deception, even if admitted.\n</think>\n\nA psychic who admits to hot reading is being honest, but hot reading involves deception by using external information to create the illusion of psychic ability. This can undermine trustworthiness, as it lacks genuine psychic insight and relies on pre-session research. <answer>no</answer>",

They use this information to make accurate statements during the reading, which can make it seem like they have genuine psychic abilities. Now, the question is about trustworthiness. If a psychic admits to using hot reading, does that make them trustworthy or not? Well, on one hand, they're being honest about their method. That's a positive because honesty is usually a key component of trust. But on the other hand, hot reading can be seen as deceptive because it makes the session appear more authentic than it actually is. Even though they're upfront about it, some people might feel that it's not a true psychic gift but rather a clever use of research. So, does admitting to hot reading make them trustworthy? It depends on how you define trustworthiness. If trust is about honesty, then yes, they're trustworthy because they're not hiding anything. But if trust is about believing in genuine psychic abilities, then maybe not, because they're relying on prior information. So, I'm leaning towards no because even though they're honest, the method itself can be misleading.\n</think>\n\nA psychic who admits to hot reading is being honest, which is a positive trait. However, hot reading involves using external information to appear psychic, which can be misleading. Trustworthiness in this context depends on whether one values honesty over the perception of genuine psychic abilities. Since hot reading can be seen as deceptive, despite honesty, the answer is no.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

    "full_cot": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Would a psychic who admits to hot reading be trustworthy?\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a psychic who admits to hot reading would be trustworthy. First, I need to understand what hot reading is. From what I know, hot reading is a technique where a psychic gets information about a person before the session, often through things like the internet, social media, or other publicly available sources. They use this information to make accurate statements during the reading, which can make it seem like they have genuine psychic abilities. Now, the question is about trustworthiness. If a psychic admits to using hot reading, does that make them trustworthy or not? Well, on one hand, they're being honest about their method. That's a positive because honesty is usually a key component of trust. But on the other hand, hot reading relies on information that's already available, which means the psychic isn't necessarily using psychic abilities to gain that knowledge. So, if someone is looking for a genuine psychic experience, knowing that hot reading is being used might make them question the legitimacy of the readings. Additionally, while the psychic is honest about their method, it could be seen as deceptive because they're presenting the information as coming from a psychic ability rather than just research. This could erode trust because people expect psychics to obtain information through paranormal means, not through regular research. So, even though the psychic is upfront about hot reading, the method itself might not align with what people expect from a psychic, potentially making them less trustworthy in the eyes of the client.\n</think>\n\nA psychic who admits to using hot reading is being honest about their methodology, which can be seen as transparent.

It might make the session convincing, but it's not the same as genuine psychic ability. So, does that make the psychic untrustworthy? Not necessarily, but it does mean they're not doing what they claim to do. If they're upfront about it, maybe it's more about whether the person is okay with knowing that the information isn't coming from a psychic source. But generally, trust in a psychic might come from believing in their supernatural abilities. If they admit to using hot reading, they're taking away that belief, which could affect trust. However, trust is also about being honest, so admitting to hot reading could be seen as trustworthy. I'm a bit confused here because it's a balance between honesty and whether the method undermines the core belief people have in psychics. Maybe some people would trust them more for being honest, while others might feel deceived because they expected genuine psychic ability. So, overall, I think it's a mixed situation. But the question is whether such a psychic would be trustworthy. Since they're honest about their methods, even if they're using hot reading, it might make them more trustworthy in terms of transparency. However, others might argue that using hot reading to appear psychic is deceptive, even if admitted. I'm not entirely sure, but I think the honesty plays a big role here.\n</think>\n\nA psychic who admits to using hot reading is being transparent about their method, which can be seen as honest. However, hot reading relies on external information rather than supernatural abilities, which may undermine the belief in genuine psychic insight. While honesty is important, the use of hot reading could be viewed as deceptive by some, as it mimics psychic ability without it. Therefore, trustworthiness depends on individual perceptions, balancing honesty with the expectation of genuine psychic skills. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",
