His wife might have been part of the act, but the primary action was by Harry.\n\nSo, putting it together, while Bess Houdini was involved in maintaining her husband's legacy, the main person responsible for making psychics look foolish was Harry Houdini. Therefore, the answer is probably no, his wife didn't make psychics look foolish; it was more her husband's work.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini, not his wife, was the primary figure known for exposing psychics and spiritualists as frauds. While Bess Houdini supported his work, the debunking was mainly done by Harry. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",

I'm not entirely sure if she was the one operating the box or if she was just involved in some capacity. I think she continued his work after his death, which included debunking psychics.

During the time Houdini was active, there was a lot of interest in spiritualism, especially after World War I. People were looking for answers and comfort, which made psychics and mediums popular. Houdini and his wife were part of a movement to expose the fraudulence of these practices, so their efforts would have had a significant impact.\n\nIn summary, Bess Houdini continued her husband's work by using the Houdini Box to test psychics, which often led to them failing and thus appearing foolish.

He was also known for debunking psychics and spiritualists. I think he was pretty vocal about exposing frauds in the psychic community. Now, his wife, Bess Houdini, was part of his act, right? They were a team, so she must have been involved in some of his performances.\n\nI think after Houdini's death in 1926, Bess became involved in something called the \"Houdini Box.\" I've heard that this was a device used to test psychics. The idea was that psychics would try to contact Harry through the box, but it was designed in a way that made it nearly impossible. So, if a psychic couldn't communicate with Harry through the box, it would expose them as frauds.\n\nBut wait, did Bess actually make psychics look foolish, or was it more about Houdini's legacy? I'm not entirely sure if she was the one operating the box or if she was just involved in some capacity. I think she continued his work after his death, which included debunking psychics. So, by using the Houdini Box, she was essentially challenging psychics to prove their abilities, and if they failed, it would make them look foolish.\n\nI also recall that there were several high-profile psychics who tried the box, and most failed. This would have brought attention to the fact that many psychics are not genuine and rely on tricks or deception. So, in that sense, Bess Houdini was contributing to exposing psychics as frauds.\n\nBut I'm not 100% certain if it's accurate to say that she made them look foolish. Maybe it's more about the method used, like the Houdini Box, rather than her personally making them look bad. However, the outcome was that psychics were indeed shown to be ineffective, which could be seen as making them look foolish.\n\nI should also consider the historical context. During the time Houdini was active, there was a lot of interest in spiritualism, especially after World War I. People were looking for answers and comfort, which made psychics and mediums popular. Houdini and his wife were part of a movement to expose the fraudulence of these practices, so their efforts would have had a significant impact.\n\nIn summary, Bess Houdini continued her husband's work by using the Houdini Box to test psychics, which often led to them failing and thus appearing foolish. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that she did make psychics look foolish by exposing their tricks.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini's wife, Bess Houdini, continued her husband's work after his death by using the Houdini Box to test psychics. This device was designed to expose frauds in the psychic community, leading many psychics to fail and appear foolish. Therefore, Bess Houdini did contribute to making psychics look foolish by exposing their deceptive practices.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

He was very skeptical and often exposed frauds in the psychic community. His wife, Bess Houdini, was his partner and also part of his act. But did she do anything to make psychics look foolish?\n\nI remember hearing that after Houdini's death in 1926, Bess became involved in some kind of mediumship attempts, maybe trying to contact Harry through psychic means. There's a famous story about a medium named Mrs. Ada GK-bordered who claimed to have communicated with Houdini's spirit. Bess apparently gave her a message from Harry that was a code only they knew, like \"Rosabelle\" or something similar. This was supposed to prove that communication was possible.\n\nBut wait, if Bess was trying to contact Harry through a psychic and it worked, wouldn't that make psychics look more legitimate rather than foolish? Maybe I'm mixing up the details. Did she later retract her statement or expose that it was a trick? Or did she actually believe in psychics after her husband's death?\n\nI think Houdini was very against psychics and mediums, and he even set up a $10,000 prize for anyone who could produce a genuine supernatural event. No one ever claimed the prize. So, if Bess was involved in any psychic activities, it might have been under the understanding that it was a hoax or part of their act to expose psychics.\n\nBut the question is whether she made psychics look foolish. If she participated in a psychic demonstration that turned out to be fake, that would make psychics look foolish. However, if it was genuine, it wouldn't. I'm a bit confused because I thought the incident with Mrs.-bordered was presented as a successful mediumship, which would have supported psychics, not made them look bad.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mistaken. Perhaps Bess later admitted that the communication was a fraud, which would mean she was involved in making psychics look foolish by exposing the medium. Or maybe she did it unknowingly, and later realized it was a trick. I'm not sure. \n\nI think the key point is whether Bess Houdini took actions that exposed psychics as frauds. Since Houdini was known for that, maybe she carried on his work, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, if she tried to use psychics and it didn't work out, that could have made them look foolish. \n\nAnother angle: Houdini was very vocal about exposing psychics, so his wife might have followed in that vein.

If it was a fake, then yes; if it was real, then no.\n\nWait, I think the message from Houdini to Bess was a code that only they knew, and the medium claimed to have received it. But Houdini had arranged for the message beforehand, so it wasn't real.

I think she might have been involved in some of the tests or perhaps even in some of the performances where psychics were shown to be fraudulent. For example, maybe she would assist in exposing the tricks psychics used, or perhaps she was part of the act that demonstrated how psychics' claims could be replicated through clever deception.\n\nI also recall that after Houdini's death, Bess continued to work with his estate and was involved in promoting his legacy, including his debunking efforts. She might have been part of the team that continued to expose psychics, thereby making them look foolish by showing their methods.\n\nSo, putting it together, it seems that while Harry Houdini was the public face of debunking psychics, his wife Bess was actively involved in his work. She likely helped in making psychics appear foolish by participating in the investigations, performances, and exposures that demonstrated the lack of genuine supernatural abilities in psychics.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be yes, Harry Houdini's wife made psychics look foolish by assisting in his efforts to expose them as frauds.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini's wife, Bess Houdini, was actively involved in her husband's work to debunk psychics and mediums. She assisted in exposing the fraudulent practices of psychics, contributing to the efforts that made them appear foolish. <answer>yes</answer>",

That would mean she wasn't making psychics look foolish but perhaps was part of the same group they were trying to expose.\n\nSo, putting it together, Houdini actively worked to expose psychics, but his wife might not have been involved in that. Instead, she might have been more focused on their performances and later on her own claims, which were more about supporting the supernatural rather than debunking it. Therefore, it's unlikely that she made psychics look foolish; in fact, her actions might have been the opposite.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini was known for debunking psychics, but his wife, Bess Houdini, primarily focused on their performances and later claimed mediumship, which supported paranormal claims rather than exposing them. Therefore, she did not make psychics look foolish.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

This might have been a way to expose the fakes, showing that even his own wife couldn't get through, implying the mediums were lying.\n\nAlso, during their performances, Bess would sometimes assist in tricks that seemed to have a psychic element, but they were actually just clever magic. So in that sense, she was helping to make psychics look foolish by demonstrating that what seemed like supernatural abilities could be explained by magic and trickery.\n\nI should check if there are any specific instances where Bess directly exposed psychics. I think she was involved in some of the debunking efforts, especially after Houdini's death. She didn't just sit back; she actively participated in showing that the psychics had no real ability.\n\nSo putting it all together, yes, Bess Houdini did help in making psychics look foolish by participating in exposing fraudulent mediums and by being part of Houdini's performances that demonstrated that so-called psychic abilities were just magic tricks.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini, a renowned magician and skeptic of paranormal claims, worked with his wife, Bess Houdini, to expose fraudulent psychics. Bess played a role in their performances and debunking efforts, including after Houdini's death in 1926, where she participated in challenges to reveal the fraudulence of mediums claiming to communicate with Houdini. Thus, Bess Houdini contributed to making psychics look foolish by demonstrating that their abilities could be explained through trickery and magic.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

I remember hearing that he had a strong interest in exposing frauds in the spiritualist movement.\n\nNow, his wife, Bess Houdini, played a significant role in his career. She was his partner in his magic acts, and I think she also supported him in his efforts to expose psychics. After his death, Bess became involved in some of the medium activities, which was a bit confusing because Harry had been against that. \n\nWait, I think there was a specific incident where Bess claimed to have communicated with Harry after his death. Harry had a code system with her, like using a certain number of knocks, to verify if a medium was genuine. After his death, Bess apparently received messages from a medium named Eileen J. Garrett, who claimed to have communicated with Harry. \n\nBut here's the thing: Harry had set up a code where only Bess knew the secret message. If a medium could accurately convey that message, it would prove they were genuine. However, when Garrett claimed to have communicated with Harry, she didn't get the correct code. Instead, she provided a message that Bess had written to Harry, which was public knowledge. This made it seem like Garrett was faking it because she didn't have the secret code.\n\nSo, Bess's actions in this situation exposed Garrett as a fraud. By not receiving the correct code and instead providing a known message, it showed that the medium wasn't genuine. Therefore, Bess effectively made the psychic look foolish by revealing the fraud.\n\nI'm pretty sure this is accurate, but I should double-check the details. Harry and Bess were both involved in exposing psychics, and after his death, Bess's role in debunking continued. The incident with Garrett is a well-known example where Bess used their secret code to show that the medium was not legitimate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, yes, Harry Houdini's wife, Bess, did make psychics look foolish by exposing fraudulent mediums through their secret code and public statements.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini's wife, Bess, played a role in exposing fraudulent psychics, particularly after Harry's death when she debunked claims by mediums like Eileen J. Garrett. By using a secret code that only she knew, Bess revealed that Garrett's messages were not genuine, thereby making the psychic appear foolish. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",
