I recall that after Houdini's death in 1926, Bess became quite involved in trying to contact him through various mediums. She held seances, and there were claims that she was able to communicate with him. If that's true, then maybe she believed in psychics, which might contradict the idea that she made them look foolish. Alternatively, perhaps she used her position to expose fakes, continuing Harry's work. I'm a bit confused because I know Houdini was very critical of psychics, and he even had a challenge where he offered a reward to anyone who could produce evidence of psychic ability under controlled conditions. No one ever won that challenge. So, if Bess Houdini continued his legacy, she might have done similar things, making psychics look foolish by exposing their tricks. On the other hand, if she genuinely believed in psychics and participated in seances, that might not make psychics look foolish but rather support their claims. I'm trying to remember any specific instances where Bess Houdini debunked psychics. I think she did participate in exposing fraudulent mediums, especially after Harry's death when she was trying to find a genuine way to communicate with him. If she found psychics who were faking it, she might have publicly exposed them, thereby making psychics look foolish. So, putting it all together, it seems that Bess Houdini did engage in efforts to expose fake psychics, continuing her husband's work. Therefore, yes, she made psychics look foolish by exposing their fraudulence.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini, a renowned magician and skeptic of psychics, often exposed fraudulent mediums.

Therefore, I think the answer is yes, because her inability to receive the secret message through psychics demonstrated that they were likely faking their abilities.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini, the renowned magician, was known for his skepticism towards psychics and his efforts to expose fraudulent mediums. His wife, Bess Houdini, became involved in seances after his death in 1926, attempting to contact him. Houdini had established a secret code to communicate with her posthumously. Since Bess never reported seeing this code, it implied that the psychics claiming to channel Houdini were likely fraudulent. Although Bess's primary focus was contacting her husband, her lack of success with the secret code inadvertently exposed the psychics as fakes. Thus, her actions did make psychics look foolish.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

I should also consider the time period. In the 1920s and 1930s, there was a lot of interest in the occult and spiritualism, especially after World War I. Houdini's work was partly about debunking these trends, and his wife might have supported him in that. However, after his death, her focus shifted more to trying to contact him rather than debunking psychics. So, while she might have been involved in some activities that exposed psychic fraud, her primary role after his death was more about the attempt to communicate with him rather than making psychics look foolish.

Question: Did Harry Houdini's wife make psychics look foolish?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether Harry Houdini's wife made psychics look foolish. I'm not too familiar with all the details, but I'll try to break it down step by step. First, I know that Harry Houdini was a famous magician and escape artist in the late 1800s and early 1900s. He was known for his incredible tricks and his skepticism towards psychics and spiritualists. He often exposed frauds in the psychic community, claiming that many of them were faking their abilities. Now, about his wife, Bess Houdini. I remember hearing that she was his partner in his performances, but I'm not sure about her role regarding psychics. I think she was involved in some of his debunking efforts, but I'm not certain. I recall that after Houdini's death in 1926, Bess became quite involved in trying to contact him through various mediums. She held seances and even offered a $10,000 reward to anyone who could produce a genuine supernatural phenomenon. Interestingly, no one ever claimed the reward, which suggests that either the mediums couldn't produce anything real, or Bess was skeptical herself. If Bess was actively involved in testing psychics and mediums without any successful outcomes, that would make psychics look foolish. So, putting it all together, it seems like Bess Houdini did play a role in exposing psychics by organizing these seances and challenges, and since none succeeded, it likely made psychics appear as frauds. Therefore, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini's wife, Bess, did contribute to making psychics look foolish.

She held seances and even offered a $10,000 reward to anyone who could produce a genuine supernatural event, which was a way to test psychics and mediums. She never paid out the reward, suggesting that she didn't find any convincing evidence. So, in that sense, she was making a public challenge to psychics, which might have made them look foolish if they couldn't produce the results. Additionally, Houdini himself had a strong stance against psychics, and Bess continued his legacy after his death. She didn't just sit back; she actively participated in exposing frauds, which would have made psychics look foolish if they were caught.

She held seances and even offered a $10,000 reward to anyone who could produce a genuine supernatural phenomenon. However, no one ever claimed the reward, which suggests that she didn't find any convincing evidence. This makes me think that she was also skeptical of psychics and worked to expose them as frauds. So, putting it all together, since both Harry and Bess were involved in exposing psychic frauds, it's likely that she contributed to making psychics look foolish by supporting her husband's efforts and continuing them after his death. Therefore, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini and his wife, Bess, were both known for their skepticism towards psychics and their efforts to expose fraudulent mediums.

He was known for his incredible tricks and his skepticism towards psychics and spiritualists. He often exposed frauds in the psychic community, claiming that many of them were faking their abilities. Now, about his wife, Bess Houdini. I remember hearing that she was his partner in his performances, but I'm not sure about her role regarding psychics. I think she was involved in some of his debunking efforts, but I'm not certain. I recall that after Houdini's death in 1926, Bess became quite involved in trying to contact him through various mediums. She held seances and even offered a substantial reward to anyone who could produce a legitimate message from Houdini. No one ever claimed the reward, which made people think that she was skeptical of psychics as well. So, considering all this, it seems like both Harry and Bess Houdini were involved in exposing psychics as frauds. Harry did it through his performances and writings, and Bess continued that work after his death by challenging psychics publicly. Therefore, yes, Harry Houdini's wife did make psychics look foolish by continuing her husband's efforts to expose them as fakes.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini, a renowned magician and skeptic, actively debunked psychics and spiritualists. His wife, Bess Houdini, continued this work after his death by challenging psychics and mediums, furthering the exposure of their fraudulent practices. Therefore, she contributed to making psychics look foolish.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Question: Did Harry Houdini's wife make psychics look foolish?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether Harry Houdini's wife made psychics look foolish. I'm not too familiar with all the details, but I'll try to break it down step by step. First, I know that Harry Houdini was a famous magician and escape artist in the late 1800s and early 1900s. He was known for his incredible tricks and his skepticism towards psychics and spiritualists. He often exposed frauds in the psychic community, claiming that many of them were faking their abilities. Now, about his wife, Bess Houdini. I remember hearing that she was his partner in his performances, but I'm not sure about her role regarding psychics. I think she was involved in some of his debunking efforts, but I'm not certain. I recall that after Houdini's death in 1926, Bess became quite involved in trying to contact him through various mediums. She held seances and even offered a reward for anyone who could successfully communicate with Houdini's spirit. However, she never found anyone who could do it convincingly, and eventually, she concluded that there was no such thing as spiritualistic communication. So, in a way, she was skeptical and critical of psychics, similar to her husband. Therefore, by continuing to challenge psychics and not finding any credible evidence, she might have contributed to making psychics look foolish. But I'm not entirely sure if she took active steps to expose them or if it was more about her own beliefs and the lack of evidence. I think the main point is that both Harry and Bess Houdini were skeptical of psychics, and through their actions and exposures, they made psychics look foolish.
