He was known for his incredible tricks and his skepticism towards psychics and spiritualists. He often exposed frauds in the psychic community.\n\nNow, his wife was Bess Houdini, right? I remember hearing that she was his partner in his performances, but I'm not sure about her role regarding psychics. I think after Houdini's death in 1926, Bess became involved in some sort of mediumship to communicate with him. There were reports that she held s\u00e9ances claiming to contact his spirit. But did she make psychics look foolish?\n\nWait, Houdini was known for debunking psychics. He worked with the Society of Psychical Research and exposed many fraudulent mediums. After his death, Bess continued to promote herself as a medium, claiming to have genuine communications with Harry. I think this led to some psychics being exposed as fakes, but I'm not sure if it was her doing it or if she was part of the issue.\n\nSo, the question is whether Bess Houdini made psychics look foolish. From what I understand, Houdini did the exposing of psychics, and Bess continued the tradition by debunking some psychics through her own performances. Therefore, yes, she did contribute to making psychics look foolish by exposing their tricks and frauds, similar to what her husband did.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini, known for his skepticism and exposing fraudulent psychics, worked with the Society of Psychical Research to debunk many psychics. After his death, his wife, Bess Houdini, continued this by claiming to communicate with his spirit through s\u00e9ances. These claims exposed some psychics as frauds, thereby making psychics look foolish. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

I think she was involved in some of his work, but I'm not sure about her role regarding psychics.\n\nI think Bess Houdini was also an accomplice in some of his performances, but I don't recall her directly targeting psychics. Maybe she helped him in some way during his investigations? I'm trying to remember if there's any specific incident where she exposed a psychic. I think there's a story about Houdini and his wife attending a s\u00e9ance, and Houdini was able to expose the medium as a fraud. But I'm not sure if Bess played a role in that or if it was something Houdini did on his own.\n\nWait, I think Houdini was particularly interested in exposing fraudulent psychics, especially after his wife's death. He tried to contact her through mediums, but he was never convinced by any of them, which made him more determined to expose the fakes. So, maybe his wife's death was a motivating factor, but did she, while alive, make psychics look foolish? I don't think she was the one doing the exposing; it was more Houdini's doing.\n\nI also recall that Houdini and Bess were a team, but their main focus was on magic, not on debunking psychics. Houdini's debunking was more of a personal crusade, especially later in his life. So, perhaps his wife didn't play a significant role in making psychics look foolish. It was more about Houdini's efforts.\n\nAnother angle is to think about whether Bess Houdini had any public interactions with psychics or mediums. I don't remember any major incidents where she exposed psychics. It seems like Houdini was the one who took on that role, using his knowledge of magic tricks and illusions to reveal how psychics were faking their results.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while Houdini made psychics look foolish by exposing their tricks, his wife Bess was more involved in his magic performances rather than directly confronting psychics. Therefore, the answer would likely be no, she didn't make psychics look foolish; it was her husband who did that.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini was a prominent figure in exposing fraudulent psychics, driven by his skepticism and personal experiences, including his failed attempts to contact his deceased wife, Bess, through mediums. However, it was Houdini himself, not his wife, who actively debunked psychics. Bess Houdini's role was primarily as his partner in magic performances, not in directly exposing psychics. Therefore, she did not make psychics look foolish.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

Houdini was against psychics because he saw them as frauds. He wanted to expose them. After his death, Bess continued to claim she received messages from him. If she was using genuine psychic abilities, that would make psychics look legitimate. But if she was using tricks, then psychics would look foolish because their claims were based on deception.\n\nBut Houdini was a magician, so it's more likely that he and Bess had a system in place, like a code, that others couldn't fake. So when psychics claimed to get messages from Harry, they couldn't produce the correct code, which Houdini had set up. Therefore, those psychics looked foolish because they couldn't produce the evidence they claimed to have.\n\nWait, so if Bess continued to claim messages from Harry using a secret code, then psychics who tried to do the same without knowing the code would fail, making psychics look foolish. So in that sense, yes, Bess's actions did make psychics look foolish because she had the genuine method, and others couldn't replicate it, exposing them as frauds.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check some facts. Houdini was known to have a code with Bess, and he challenged mediums to produce messages matching that code. When they couldn't, it exposed them as fakes. So Bess's role was to uphold that challenge, thereby making psychics look foolish when they failed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, yes, Harry Houdini's wife, Bess, did make psychics look foolish by continuing to claim messages from Harry using a secret code that others couldn't replicate, thus exposing the psychics as frauds.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini, a renowned magician and skeptic of psychics, worked with his wife, Bess, to expose fraudulent mediums. After Houdini's death, Bess continued to claim she received messages from him using a secret code they had established. This code was designed to be unique and unforgeable, challenging psychics to replicate it. When psychics failed to do so, it exposed their claims as fraudulent, thereby making psychics look foolish. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

He often exposed them as frauds. His wife, Bess, was his partner in his performances, and I think she sometimes took part in his acts. But did she make psychics look foolish? \n\nWait, I think there's something about Houdini's death and how Bess was involved after that. Houdini died in 1926, and I believe he had a will that offered a reward to anyone who could prove they had supernatural powers by contacting him after his death. Bess, as his wife, might have been involved in managing that challenge. \n\nSo, Houdini's will offered $10,000 to anyone who could produce a valid psychic message from him. Bess was the one who had to evaluate the claims. I think she never paid out the money because she didn't believe any of the psychics succeeded. This would mean that she, in her role as his executor, made psychics look foolish by not accepting their claims as genuine. \n\nTherefore, yes, Harry Houdini's wife, Bess, did make psychics look foolish by not accepting any of their supposed communications with Houdini after his death, effectively debunking their claims.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini's wife, Bess, played a role in debunking psychics by refusing to accept any claims of successful communication with Houdini after his death. She managed his will, which offered a reward to psychics who could prove supernatural contact, but she never awarded the money, thereby making psychics appear foolish.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

So, the answer might be that she didn't directly make psychics look foolish, but she supported Houdini's efforts in doing so. \n\nWait, but the question is whether she made psychics look foolish. If her support and involvement in Houdini's performances, which were designed to expose psychic fraud, contributed to that, then maybe the answer is yes. But I'm still a bit unsure because I don't have specific evidence of her directly making psychics look foolish. \n\nI think I'll go with the idea that, while Bess Houdini was primarily a performer and assistant, her involvement in Houdini's career, which was aimed at exposing psychics, might have indirectly made psychics look foolish. So, the answer would be yes.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini's wife, Bess Houdini, was primarily known for her role as his assistant and partner in their performances. While she supported Houdini's career, which included his efforts to expose fraudulent psychics, there is no direct evidence that she personally made psychics look foolish. Her involvement was more about supporting her husband's work rather than directly confronting psychics. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

I wonder if Bess was involved in this aspect of his work. \n\nFrom what I recall, Houdini was deeply involved in trying to contact his deceased wife after her death, which happened in 1926. He even offered a substantial reward to any psychic who could successfully communicate with her.

I think she was more of a stage assistant, but maybe she also had some role in testing psychics. \n\nI've heard the term \"Houdini's challenge\" referring to his offer to psychics, but I'm not sure if Bess was directly involved in making psychics look foolish.

His wife, Bess Houdini, played a role in his performances but also supported his skepticism.

She focused more on her role as his partner and, later, carrying on his legacy after his passing.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini, known for his skepticism towards psychics, actively debunked them by exposing their tricks.
