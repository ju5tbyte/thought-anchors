  "solution": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether Harry Houdini's wife made psychics look foolish. I'm not too familiar with all the details, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Harry Houdini was a famous magician and escape artist in the late 1800s and early 1900s. He was known for his incredible tricks and his skepticism towards psychics and spiritualists. He often exposed frauds in the psychic community, claiming that many of them were faking their abilities.\n\nNow, about his wife, Bess Houdini. I remember hearing that she was his partner in his performances, but I'm not sure about her role regarding psychics. I think she was involved in some of his debunking efforts, but I'm not certain.\n\nI recall that after Houdini's death in 1926, Bess became quite involved in trying to contact him through various mediums. She held seances and even offered a $10,000 reward to anyone who could produce a genuine supernatural phenomenon that would make her believe in the afterlife. However, no one ever claimed the reward, which suggests that she didn't find any convincing evidence.\n\nBut the question is whether she made psychics look foolish. Well, Houdini himself was known for exposing psychics as frauds. He used his skills as a magician to reveal the tricks they used. Bess, being his wife and a close collaborator, probably supported this by continuing his work after his death. She likely didn't invent any new methods but carried on his legacy of exposing frauds.\n\nHowever, the question is about making psychics look foolish. While Houdini exposed them, Bess's main role was in the context of seances and the reward. She didn't actively debunk psychics in the same way Houdini did. Instead, she provided a challenge that psychics couldn't meet, which in a way did make them look ineffective, but it's more about the challenge than direct exposure.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think Bess Houdini did contribute to making psychics look foolish by continuing her husband's work and setting a challenge that they couldn't fulfill. She didn't do it as actively as Houdini, but her actions had a similar effect.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini, a renowned magician and skeptic, was known for exposing psychics as frauds.
