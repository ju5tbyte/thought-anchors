Now, about his wife, Bess Houdini. I remember hearing that she was his partner in his performances, but I'm not sure about her role regarding psychics. I think she was involved in some of his debunking efforts, but I'm not certain. I recall that after Houdini's death in 1926, Bess became quite involved in trying to contact him through various mediums. She held seances and even offered a $10,000 reward to anyone who could produce a genuine supernatural phenomenon that would make her believe in the afterlife. However, no one ever claimed the reward, which suggests that she didn't find any convincing evidence. But the question is whether she made psychics look foolish. Well, Houdini himself was known for exposing psychics as frauds. He used his skills as a magician to reveal the tricks they used. Bess, being his wife and a close collaborator, probably supported this by continuing his work after his death. She likely didn't invent any new methods but carried on his legacy of exposing frauds.

Now, about his wife, Bess Houdini. I remember hearing that she was his partner in his performances, but I'm not sure about her role regarding psychics. I think she was involved in some of his debunking efforts, but I'm not certain. I recall that after Houdini's death in 1926, Bess became quite involved in trying to contact him through various mediums. She held seances and even offered a $10,000 reward to anyone who could produce a genuine supernatural phenomenon that would make her believe in the afterlife. However, no one ever claimed the reward, which suggests that she didn't find any convincing evidence. But the question is whether she made psychics look foolish. Well, Houdini himself was known for exposing psychics as frauds. He used his skills as a magician to reveal the tricks they used.

However, the question is about making psychics look foolish. I think Houdini did that with his exposures, but whether Bess specifically did so is less clear. She might have, by continuing his debunking efforts, but it's not as prominent as Houdini's direct actions.

I recall that after Houdini's death in 1926, Bess became quite involved in trying to contact him through various mediums. She held seances and even offered a $10,000 reward to anyone who could produce a genuine supernatural phenomenon that would make her believe in the afterlife. However, no one ever claimed the reward, which suggests that she didn't find any convincing evidence. But the question is whether she made psychics look foolish. Well, Houdini himself was known for exposing psychics as frauds. He used his skills as a magician to reveal the tricks they used. Bess, being his wife and a close collaborator, probably supported this by continuing his work after his death. She likely didn't invent any new methods but carried on his legacy of exposing frauds. However, the question is about making psychics look foolish. I'm not sure if she did any specific acts that made psychics look foolish on her own, or if it was more about continuing her husband's efforts. Since Houdini was the main figure in exposing psychics, it's possible that Bess's actions, especially the seances and the failed attempts to contact Houdini, might have inadvertently shown that psychics couldn't produce the results they claimed. This could have made psychics look foolish by highlighting the lack of genuine supernatural ability. So, putting it all together, I think that while Bess Houdini didn't do the exposing herself, her actions and the lack of success in finding genuine psychics probably contributed to making psychics look foolish. Therefore, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini's wife, Bess Houdini, did not actively expose psychics as frauds herself, but her actions, particularly the failed attempts to contact her late husband through mediums, contributed to highlighting the lack of genuine supernatural abilities, thereby making psychics appear foolish. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

He was known for his incredible tricks and his skepticism towards psychics and spiritualists. He often exposed frauds in the psychic community, claiming that many of them were faking their abilities. Now, about his wife, Bess Houdini. I remember hearing that she was his partner in his performances, but I'm not sure about her role regarding psychics. I think she was involved in some of his debunking efforts, but I'm not certain. I recall that after Houdini's death in 1926, Bess became quite involved in trying to contact him through various mediums. She held seances and even offered a $10,000 reward to anyone who could produce a genuine supernatural phenomenon that would make her believe in the afterlife. However, no one ever claimed the reward, which suggests that she didn't find any convincing evidence. But the question is whether she made psychics look foolish. Well, Houdini himself was known for exposing psychics as frauds. He used his skills as a magician to reveal the tricks they used. Bess, being his wife and a close collaborator, probably supported this by continuing his work after his death. She likely didn't invent any new methods but carried on his legacy of exposing frauds. However, the question is about making psychics look foolish. I think Houdini's efforts were more about exposing the fraudulence, not necessarily making them look foolish. But if Bess continued that work, she might have contributed to it as well. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to her role in the context of psychics trying to contact Houdini, which didn't work, thereby making psychics look ineffective. So, considering all this, I think the answer is yes, because both Houdini and his wife were involved in exposing psychic fraud, thereby making psychics appear foolish.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini was a prominent magician known for exposing psychics as frauds. His wife, Bess Houdini, continued his work after his death by debunking psychics and offering a reward for genuine supernatural evidence, which was never claimed. This involvement likely contributed to making psychics appear foolish.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Now, about his wife, Bess Houdini. I remember hearing that she was his partner in his performances, but I'm not sure about her role regarding psychics. I think she was involved in some of his debunking efforts, but I'm not certain. I recall that after Houdini's death in 1926, Bess became quite involved in trying to contact him through various mediums. She held seances and even offered a $10,000 reward to anyone who could produce a genuine supernatural phenomenon that would make her believe in the afterlife. However, no one ever claimed the reward, which suggests that she didn't find any convincing evidence. But the question is whether she made psychics look foolish. Well, Houdini himself was known for exposing psychics as frauds. He used his skills as a magician to reveal the tricks they used. Bess, being his wife and a close collaborator, probably supported this by continuing his work after his death. She likely didn't invent any new methods but carried on his legacy of exposing frauds. However, the question is about making psychics look foolish. Since Houdini did a lot of that during his lifetime, it's possible that Bess continued that reputation. But I'm not sure if she personally made psychics look foolish in the same way her husband did. Maybe she didn't actively do so but maintained his legacy. I'm not entirely certain, but considering her role and the fact that she continued his debunking efforts, it's plausible that she contributed to psychics looking foolish by exposing their tricks.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini's wife, Bess Houdini, did not personally make psychics look foolish in the same way her husband did. However, she carried on his legacy of skepticism and debunking by continuing his work after his death, which may have contributed to psychics being perceived as frauds. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

So, while she supported his work, the primary person who made psychics look foolish was Harry Houdini himself. Therefore, I don't think she made psychics look foolish in the same way he did. Maybe she did in her own way, but it's not as well-known as her husband's efforts.\n</think>\n\nHarry Houdini was known for exposing psychics as frauds, but his wife, Bess Houdini, primarily focused on trying to contact him after his death rather than debunking psychics herself.
