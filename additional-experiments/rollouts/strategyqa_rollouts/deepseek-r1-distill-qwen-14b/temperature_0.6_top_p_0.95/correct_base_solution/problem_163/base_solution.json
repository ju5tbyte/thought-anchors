  "prompt": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Are moose used for work near the kingdom of Arendelle?\n<think>\n",
  "solution": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether moose are used for work near the kingdom of Arendelle. First, I should think about where Arendelle is. From what I remember, Arendelle is the setting of the movie \"Frozen.\" In the movie, Arendelle is a fictional kingdom, probably inspired by Scandinavian countries like Norway or Sweden. Those places are known for having cold climates and lots of forests, which makes sense for a kingdom with ice and snow.\n\nNow, moose are large animals that live in the northern parts of the world, including places like Canada, the northern United States, and parts of Europe like Sweden and Finland. So, if Arendelle is inspired by these regions, it's possible that moose are present there.\n\nIn real life, people use animals for work in various ways. For example, horses are used for riding and pulling carts, and in some places, other animals like oxen or even elephants are used for similar tasks. Moose are strong animals, so maybe they could be used for work, like pulling sleds or carrying loads. I'm not sure if this is a common practice, though.\n\nIn the \"Frozen\" movies, there's a character named Sven who is a moose with a carriage. Sven is a friend of Kristoff and helps him around. So, in the fictional universe of Arendelle, moose are definitely present and even used for transportation. Sven pulls Kristoff around on a sled, which seems like a working role.\n\nTherefore, based on the movie's portrayal, it's clear that moose are used for work near Arendelle. Sven's role as a working moose supports this.\n</think>\n\nIn the fictional kingdom of Arendelle, inspired by Scandinavian countries, moose are indeed used for work. Sven, a character from \"Frozen,\" is a moose who pulls a sled and assists Kristoff, indicating that moose are employed for transportation tasks in this setting.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",
