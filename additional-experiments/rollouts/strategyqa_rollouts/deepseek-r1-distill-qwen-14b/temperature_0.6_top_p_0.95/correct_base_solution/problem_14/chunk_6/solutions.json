So, when the nobles elected the ruler, it was indeed the landowners making that decision. \n\nPutting it all together, it seems that yes, landowners in the Kingdom of Hungary did elect their rulers, particularly during periods when the throne was vacant or after a dynastic change, as seen with Charles I and others. The nobility's role in selecting the king is supported by historical events and legal documents like the Golden Bull.\n</think>\n\nIn the Kingdom of Hungary, landowners, who were primarily the nobility, played a significant role in the election of rulers, especially during periods of dynastic succession or after a throne vacancy. Historical events, such as the election of Charles I of Anjou in the 14th century, and legal documents like the Golden Bull of 1222, indicate that the nobility had the power to elect their ruler. This practice was consistent with medieval European political structures, where the nobility often influenced or directly elected kings. Therefore, yes, landowners in the Kingdom of Hungary did elect their rulers.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

But the act of election itself was a significant step, involving the landowners and other nobles. \n\nI should also consider the context of the Kingdom of Hungary. It was a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural kingdom, which might have influenced the political structure. The elective monarchy could have been a way to balance power among different noble families and ensure that no single family had too much control. This system might have lasted until the kingdom was absorbed into larger empires, like the Habsburgs, which changed the political dynamics. \n\nSo putting it all together, it seems that in the Kingdom of Hungary, landowners and nobles did participate in electing their ruler through an assembly or council. The process was formalized, especially with the Golden Bull, which made the election a key part of their political system. Therefore, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nIn the Kingdom of Hungary, the ruler was elected by a group of nobles, including landowners, through a process formalized by the Golden Bull of 1351. This system allowed the nobility to gather and choose the king, reflecting an elective monarchy structure. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Question: Did land owners elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary?\n<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether landowners elected their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary. I'm not super familiar with Hungarian history, but I'll try to break it down step by step. First, I know that the Kingdom of Hungary was a medieval kingdom that existed from around 1000 AD until the 16th century. It was part of the Habsburg Monarchy later on, but I think the question is about the earlier period. I remember that in medieval Europe, the concept of elected rulers was more common in certain regions, like the Holy Roman Empire, where some cities and regions had more autonomy. But I'm not sure about Hungary specifically. \n\nI think about how kings were typically chosen in medieval times. Usually, it was through inheritance or by appointment by existing nobles. I recall that in some cases, especially after a king died without an heir, the nobility would gather to elect the next ruler. But was this the case in Hungary? I'm not entirely sure. I also remember that Hungary had a system where the nobles, or magnates, had significant power. Maybe they had a role in selecting the king. \n\nWait, I think there was something called the \"Golden Bull\" of Hungary, which was a decree from 1351. I believe it outlined the rights and privileges of the nobility and might have included provisions about how the king was elected. If that's the case, then perhaps the landowners, or nobles, did have a say in who their ruler was. \n\nBut I'm a bit confused because I also know that Hungary was part of the Habsburg dynasty later, which was more about hereditary rule. However, that was after the initial period of the kingdom. So focusing on the earlier time, before the Habsburgs took over, it's possible that the nobles elected the king. \n\nAnother angle is to think about the coronation process. In Hungary, the king was crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary, and I think that the nobles had to agree to the coronation. This might imply that they had a role in choosing the ruler, even if it wasn't a direct election. Maybe the king was elected by the nobility, who were the landowners of the time. \n\nI should also consider the structure of the government. In some medieval kingdoms, the king's power was checked by the nobility, who could influence or even elect the ruler. If Hungary had a similar system, then yes, landowners (nobles) would have elected their ruler. \n\nPutting it all together, it seems likely that in the Kingdom of Hungary, especially during certain periods, landowners or nobles did have a role in electing their ruler, particularly when there was no clear heir. The Golden Bull and the coronation process support this idea.

    "rollout": " \n\nI think about the structure of medieval kingdoms. Usually, the ruler was a king who inherited the throne, but sometimes there were elections, especially when there was no clear heir or when powerful nobles wanted to assert their influence. In Hungary, the nobles, or magnates, were quite powerful. They might have had significant influence over who became king. For example, after the death of a king without a clear heir, the nobles might have gathered to elect the next ruler. This practice is similar to how the Pope is elected by cardinals, but in the case of a kingdom, it would be the nobility or other powerful figures. \n\nI recall that in some parts of Europe, like Poland, the nobles elected their kings, which was part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's system. Maybe Hungary had a similar system at some point. I think the Kingdom of Hungary had a unique political structure where the nobility held a lot of power, which might have included the right to elect the king. This could have been formalized in documents like the Golden Bull of 1222, which was an early form of constitutional law limiting the king's powers and granting rights to the nobility. If the nobility had such rights, it's possible they also had a say in who the king was. \n\nOn the other hand, I also know that many medieval kingdoms were hereditary, and the king's position was passed down through the royal family. So it's possible that in Hungary, while the nobles had influence, the actual election of the ruler wasn't a common practice. Maybe the king was elected in certain situations, like when the throne was vacant, but generally, it was a hereditary position. \n\nI should also consider the historical context. The Kingdom of Hungary was part of the Carolingian Empire initially, but after the Magyar conquest, it became a separate kingdom. The early kings might have had more centralized power, but over time, the nobles gained more influence. The Golden Bull of 1222 definitely gave the nobles more rights, but does that include the election of the king? I'm not entirely sure, but it's possible that in cases where there was no clear heir, the nobles would gather to elect the next king. \n\nAdditionally, I remember that during the later medieval period, the kingdom faced various challenges, including invasions and internal conflicts. In such times, the nobles might have had more say in choosing a leader who could effectively manage the kingdom's affairs. So, it's plausible that landowners, as part of the nobility, did elect their rulers in certain circumstances, especially when there was no direct heir. \n\nHowever, I'm not certain about the specifics. I think the key point is whether the election of the ruler was a regular practice or only happened in exceptional cases.

Question: Did land owners elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary?\n<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether landowners elected their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary. I'm not super familiar with Hungarian history, but I'll try to break it down step by step. First, I know that the Kingdom of Hungary was a medieval kingdom that existed from around 1000 AD until the 16th century. It was part of the Habsburg Monarchy later on, but I think the question is about the earlier period. I remember that in medieval Europe, the concept of elected rulers was more common in certain regions, like the Holy Roman Empire, where some cities and regions had more autonomy. But I'm not sure about Hungary specifically. \n\nI think about the structure of medieval kingdoms. Usually, the ruler was a king who inherited the throne, but sometimes there were elections, especially when there was no clear heir or when powerful nobles wanted to assert their influence. In Hungary, the nobles, or magnates, were quite powerful. They might have had significant influence over who became king. For example, after the death of a king without a clear heir, the nobles might have gathered to elect the next ruler. This practice is similar to how the Pope is elected by cardinals, but in the case of a kingdom, it would be the nobility or other powerful figures. \n\nI recall that in some parts of Europe, like Poland, the nobles elected their kings, which was part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's system. Maybe Hungary had a similar system at some point. I think the Kingdom of Hungary had a unique political structure where the nobility held a lot of power, which might have included the right to elect the king. This could have been formalized in documents like the Golden Bull of 1222, which was an early form of constitutional law limiting the king's powers and granting rights to the nobility. If the nobility had such rights, it's possible they also had a say in who the king was. \n\nOn the other hand, I also know that many medieval kingdoms were hereditary, and the king's position was passed down through the royal family. So it's possible that in Hungary, while the nobles had influence, the actual election of the ruler wasn't a common practice. Maybe the king was elected in certain situations, like when the throne was vacant, but generally, it was a hereditary position. \n\nI should also consider the historical context. The Kingdom of Hungary was part of the Carolingian Empire initially, but after the Magyar conquest, it became a separate kingdom. The early kings might have had more centralized power, but over time, the nobles gained more influence. The Golden Bull of 1222 definitely gave the nobles more rights, but does that include the election of the king? I'm not entirely sure, but it's possible that in cases where there was no clear heir, the nobles would gather to elect the next king. \n\nAdditionally, I remember that during the later medieval period, the kingdom faced various challenges, including invasions and internal conflicts. In such times, the nobles might have had more say in choosing a leader who could effectively manage the kingdom's affairs. So, it's plausible that landowners, as part of the nobility, did elect their rulers in certain circumstances, especially when there was no direct heir. \n\nHowever, I'm not certain about the specifics. I think the key point is whether the election of the ruler was a regular practice or only happened in exceptional cases. If the nobility had the right to elect the king, even if it wasn't the norm, then the answer would be yes. But if the king was usually hereditary and the nobles only influenced decisions in specific situations, it might be more nuanced. \n\nIn summary, considering the influence of the nobility, the existence of charters like the Golden Bull, and the context of medieval European politics, it seems likely that landowners, particularly the nobility, did have a role in electing their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary, especially when there was no clear heir.

Question: Did land owners elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary?\n<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether landowners elected their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary. I'm not super familiar with Hungarian history, but I'll try to break it down step by step. First, I know that the Kingdom of Hungary was a medieval kingdom that existed from around 1000 AD until the 16th century. It was part of the Habsburg Monarchy later on, but I think the question is about the earlier period. I remember that in medieval Europe, the concept of elected rulers was more common in certain regions, like the Holy Roman Empire, where some cities and regions had more autonomy. But I'm not sure about Hungary specifically. \n\nI think about how kings were usually chosen in medieval times. Often, it was through inheritance or military strength, but sometimes there were elections, especially when there was no clear heir. For example, in the Holy Roman Empire, the electors (usually powerful nobles or bishops) would elect the emperor. I wonder if Hungary had a similar system. \n\nI recall that Hungary had a unique political structure called the Golden Bull of 1222, which was one of the earliest legal documents limiting the power of the king and granting rights to the nobles. This document was significant because it established a kind of contract between the king and the nobility, giving the nobles certain privileges and a say in governance. So, perhaps the nobles, who were the landowners, had some influence over who the ruler would be. \n\nBut did they actually elect the ruler, or was it more of an advisory role? I think in some cases, the nobles might have had the power to choose the king, especially after the death of a monarch when there was no clear heir. For instance, after the death of a king, the nobles might convene to select the next ruler from among eligible candidates. This practice was more common in regions without a strong hereditary monarchy. \n\nI also remember that the Kingdom of Hungary had a diet, or a parliament, which included nobles.

Question: Did land owners elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary?\n<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether landowners elected their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary. I'm not super familiar with Hungarian history, but I'll try to break it down step by step. First, I know that the Kingdom of Hungary was a medieval kingdom that existed from around 1000 AD until the 16th century. It was part of the Habsburg Monarchy later on, but I think the question is about the earlier period. I remember that in medieval Europe, the concept of elected rulers was more common in certain regions, like the Holy Roman Empire, where some cities and regions had more autonomy. But I'm not sure about Hungary specifically. \n\nI think about the structure of medieval kingdoms. Usually, the king was the central ruler, and his power came from inheritance and divine right. However, in some cases, especially after the decline of a ruling dynasty, nobles or other powerful figures might elect a new ruler. For instance, during the interregnum periods when there was no clear heir, elections might occur. But I'm not certain if this was a regular practice in Hungary or just an occasional thing.\n\nI recall that in Hungary, there was a significant number of powerful nobles, or magnates, who held a lot of influence. Maybe they had some say in who the ruler would be. But was this through an election, or was it more about their support or opposition? I'm also thinking about the Golden Bull of 1222, which was a charter that limited the power of the king and granted certain rights to the nobility. This document might have some bearing on whether the nobles had a role in electing the ruler. \n\nWait, the Golden Bull was more about limiting the king's powers rather than electing him. So maybe the election wasn't formalized in that way. I'm trying to remember if there were any instances where Hungarian nobles elected a ruler. I think during the 15th century, there were periods where the throne was vacant, and the nobles might have had to choose a new king. For example, after the death of a king without an heir, the nobles could elect someone, perhaps from another dynasty. \n\nHowever, I'm not sure if this was a standard practice or just an exception. Also, considering the influence of the Habsburgs, who took over Hungary after the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526, I don't think the election process changed much. It was more about dynastic succession and control by external powers like the Habsburgs rather than elected rulers. \n\nSo, putting this together, while there might have been instances where the nobility influenced the selection of a ruler, especially during times of succession crises, it wasn't a regular or formalized process where landowners (nobles) elected their ruler through a structured system. It was more about the existing power dynamics and dynastic claims rather than a democratic election.\n</think>\n\nIn the Kingdom of Hungary, the ruler was typically selected through dynastic succession, with the king's position often inherited within a ruling family. While the nobility, or magnates, held significant influence and could play a role in the selection of a ruler during times of succession crises, this was not a formalized or regular electoral process. The Golden Bull of 1222, which limited the king's power and granted nobles certain rights, did not establish an election system. Instead, it reflected the nobles' influence in shaping the monarchy rather than electing the ruler. Therefore, landowners did not elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary through a structured system, but their support could be crucial during periods of succession.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

Often, it was through inheritance or military prowess, but sometimes there were elections, especially when there was no clear heir. For example, the pope sometimes elected emperors in the Holy Roman Empire. In Hungary, I recall that there was a system called \"Golden Liberty\" which granted certain privileges to the nobility, including the right to elect the king. This was in the 13th century, so maybe during that time, landowners (who were part of the nobility) had a say in who their ruler was. \n\nWait, but wasn't Hungary under the rule of the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty for a long time? They were the ruling family from around 1000 until 1301. So during their reign, the king was probably chosen by hereditary right, not election. But after the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty ended, there was a period where the nobles elected the next king. For instance, Charles I of Hungary was elected by the nobles in 1301. So it seems like after the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty, the landowners (nobles) did have the power to elect their ruler. \n\nHowever, I also remember that after the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526, Hungary was divided into the Kingdom of Hungary (part of the Habsburg Monarchy) and the Ottoman Empire. During the Habsburg period, the rulers were hereditary, so elections might not have been a thing anymore.

However, in some cases, especially after the decline of a ruling dynasty, nobles or other powerful figures might elect a new ruler. For example, in Poland, the monarchy was elective for a time. But was Hungary similar? I'm not certain. \n\nI recall that after the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526, which was a major defeat for Hungary against the Ottoman Empire, the Habsburgs took over. But that's more about the later period. Before that, during the 10th to 15th centuries, Hungary was under the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty, and later, the Anjou and Jagiellonian dynasties. These were all hereditary monarchies, so the rulers were typically chosen from within the ruling family. \n\nWait, but there might have been instances where, after a king died without an heir, the nobles would elect a new ruler. For example, in 1386, when Louis I of Hungary died without a male heir, his sister, Queen Mary, took the throne, but she was married to Sigismund of Luxembourg, who later became King of Hungary. So in this case, the election might have involved the nobles, but it was more of a dynastic succession rather than a free election by landowners. \n\nI also think about the role of the nobility, or the \"f\u0151v\u00e1rosi\" in Hungarian, who were powerful landowners and knights.

Once the Habsburgs took over, the ruler was the Emperor of Austria, and Hungary was part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In that case, the ruler wasn't elected by landowners but was the hereditary Habsburg monarch. \n\nSo, putting it all together, while there might have been occasional elections, especially when the throne was vacant, the general practice in the Kingdom of Hungary was that rulers were hereditary monarchs from a ruling dynasty.

However, in some cases, especially after the decline of a ruling dynasty, nobles or other powerful figures might elect a new ruler. For example, in Poland, the monarchy was elective for a time. But was Hungary similar? I'm not certain. \n\nI recall that after the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526, which was a major defeat for Hungary against the Ottoman Empire, the Habsburgs took over. But that's more about the later period. Before that, during the 10th to 15th centuries, Hungary was under the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty, and later, the Anjou and Jagiellonian dynasties. These were all hereditary monarchies, so the rulers were typically chosen from within the ruling family. \n\nWait, but there might have been instances where, after a king died without an heir, the nobles would elect a new ruler. For example, in 1386, when Louis I of Hungary died without a male heir, his sister, Queen Mary, took the throne, but she was married to Sigismund of Luxembourg, who later became King of Hungary. So in this case, the election might have involved the nobles, but it was more of a dynastic succession rather than a free election by landowners. \n\nI also think about the role of the nobility, or the \"f\u0151v\u00e1rosi\" in Hungarian, who were powerful landowners and knights. They might have had some influence in selecting a ruler, especially if the throne was vacant. However, I'm not sure if this was a regular practice or just an exception. \n\nAnother point is the distinction between the Kingdom of Hungary and the broader Habsburg territories. Once the Habsburgs took over, the ruler was the Emperor of Austria, and Hungary was part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In that case, the ruler wasn't elected by landowners but was the hereditary Habsburg monarch. \n\nSo, putting it all together, while there might have been occasional elections, especially when the throne was vacant, the general practice in the Kingdom of Hungary was that rulers were hereditary monarchs from a ruling dynasty. Landowners had influence but didn't elect the ruler in the modern sense. Therefore, the answer would likely be no, landowners didn't elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary.\n</think>\n\nThe Kingdom of Hungary, existing from around 1000 AD until the 16th century, was primarily characterized by hereditary monarchy rather than elected rulership. The ruling dynasties, such as the \u00c1rp\u00e1d, Anjou, and Jagiellonian dynasties, passed the throne through inheritance. While there were instances where nobles might influence the selection of a ruler, especially when the throne was vacant, this was not a regular practice. The nobility, or \"f\u0151v\u00e1rosi,\" had influence but did not elect the ruler in a modern sense. Thus, landowners did not elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

Also, I'm thinking about the term \"landowners\" here. In medieval Hungary, the nobility owned most of the land, so if the question is about the nobility electing the ruler, that might be a different scenario. I think in some periods, the Hungarian kings were elected by a group of nobles, which would mean that landowners (the nobility) did have a role in choosing their ruler. However, I'm not sure if this was consistent throughout the entire history of the kingdom or just during specific times, like after a vacancy in the throne or during periods of instability. I also remember that the Golden Bull of 1222, which is a significant document in Hungarian history, limited the power of the king and granted certain rights to the nobility. This might have included some form of consent or election process for the ruler. On the other hand, I also know that many medieval kingdoms had hereditary systems where the throne passed from father to son, with the nobility's approval. So, maybe the ruler was elected in the sense that the nobles had to agree to the succession, but it wasn't a direct election by all landowners. I'm a bit confused about whether the election was a formal process or just a symbolic one. I think in practice, the king was elected by a council of nobles, but this might have been more of a ceremonial act once the ruling house was established. So, putting it all together, it seems like at certain times, especially in the early medieval period, landowners (the nobility) did have a role in electing the ruler, either through direct election or by consent. Therefore, the answer would likely be yes, but I'm not 100% certain without more detailed historical knowledge.\n</think>\n\nIn the Kingdom of Hungary, the ruler was often elected by a council of nobles, who were the landowners of the time. This was especially true during the early medieval period and in cases of succession or instability. The Golden Bull of 1222 further formalized the nobility's role in consenting to the ruler. While the monarchy was generally hereditary, the nobility's consent or election was required, making the answer yes.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

The kingdom had a system where the king's power was checked by the nobles, who had their own councils. The diet, which was a assembly of nobles, played a significant role in governance. This diet could influence or even decide who the next king would be, especially in cases of succession disputes. \n\nIn summary, based on what I remember about medieval Hungary, it seems that landowners, as nobles, did have a role in electing the ruler. They would gather to choose the next king, especially when there was no clear heir. This was part of the system designed to prevent arbitrary rule and ensure that the king was acceptable to the nobility. So, the answer should be yes, landowners elected their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary during the medieval period.\n</think>\n\nYes, in the Kingdom of Hungary during the medieval period, landowners, as part of the nobility, played a role in electing the ruler. The king was often elected by the nobles, especially in cases of succession without a clear heir, through a process known as feudal election. This system, which included the \"Golden Bull\" of 1222, limited the king's power and granted the nobles significant influence, including the right to elect the ruler. Therefore, landowners did elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

But after the \u00c1rp\u00e1ds, there were periods where foreign kings were elected, like the Angevins and later the Habsburgs. \n\nSo, during the medieval period, especially after the Golden Bull, it seems that the king's position required the consent of the nobles. This might have involved an election or at least a formal approval process. The diet, made up of nobles, would have had to agree on the ruler's succession. Therefore, while the king might have been elected in some periods, especially after the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty ended, it wasn't a consistent practice throughout the entire history of the Kingdom of Hungary. \n\nPutting this all together, I think that in certain periods, landowners (nobles) did have a role in electing or at least approving the ruler, especially after the Golden Bull. So, the answer would be yes, but it wasn't a straightforward or continuous process.\n</think>\n\nIn the Kingdom of Hungary, landowners, particularly the nobility, played a role in the selection of rulers, especially during periods following the Golden Bull of 1222, which granted nobles certain rights and influenced the monarchy's structure. While the kingdom primarily had a hereditary monarchy under the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty, subsequent rulers, such as the Angevins and Habsburgs, required the consent of the nobility, often formalized through diets or councils. Thus, landowners did elect or approve their rulers in certain periods. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

But I'm not sure about Hungary specifically. \n\nI think about how kings were usually chosen in medieval Europe. Often, succession was hereditary, meaning the king's son or another relative took over. But there were exceptions, especially in places where different groups had influence. In Hungary, I recall that there was a system called the \"Golden Bull\" which was a decree that limited the king's power and gave more rights to the nobility. This was from 1359. So, maybe the nobles, who were landowners, had some say in the selection of the ruler. \n\nWait, so if the Golden Bull gave the nobility more rights, perhaps they had a role in electing the king. I think that in some cases, the nobles would gather and choose a ruler from among their ranks, especially if there was no clear heir. For example, if the previous king died without a son, the nobles might elect someone they deemed suitable. That would mean that landowners, being part of the nobility, did have a say in who became the ruler. \n\nI also remember that in the later periods, especially after the 15th century, Hungary came under the influence of the Habsburgs. But before that, during the earlier medieval period, the election by nobles was more likely. So, putting it together, it seems that yes, landowners, as part of the nobility, did elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary, especially in cases where there was no direct succession or when they wanted to ensure their interests were protected.\n</think>\n\nIn the Kingdom of Hungary, landowners, particularly the nobility, played a significant role in the political landscape. The Golden Bull of 1359 granted the nobility certain rights and a say in governance, including the election of rulers. This was especially true when there was no clear heir, allowing the nobility to choose a suitable king. Thus, landowners did elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary. <answer>yes</answer>",

For example, in the Holy Roman Empire, the Electors (princes and other high-ranking officials) could elect the emperor. But was Hungary structured similarly? \n\nI recall that the Kingdom of Hungary had its own legal and political structures. There was a diet, which was a council of nobles, bishops, and other important figures. The diet had some influence on the king's policies and could, in some cases, influence who the next ruler would be. But I'm not sure if they actually elected the king or if they just advised him. \n\nI also remember that during the 14th and 15th centuries, Hungary faced significant challenges, including the Mongol invasions and the decline of the Angevin dynasty. During these times, the nobles might have had more influence over the succession because the throne was vacant or the existing ruler was weak. So, perhaps in those specific periods, landowners or nobles had a say in choosing the ruler. \n\nBut generally, I think that the king's position was hereditary, and the diet's role was more advisory rather than electoral. The diet could oppose or limit the king's power, but they didn't elect him. So, even though the nobles had some influence, they didn't actually elect the ruler. \n\nTo sum up, while the diet of nobles and other officials had a role in the kingdom's governance, the ruler was typically elected only in exceptional circumstances, not as a standard practice. Most of the time, the king was chosen through hereditary succession, not by landowners electing them.\n</think>\n\nIn the Kingdom of Hungary, the ruler was generally chosen through hereditary succession rather than election by landowners. While the diet, composed of nobles and officials, had influence over governance and could sometimes influence succession, especially during periods of instability, the standard practice was for the throne to pass to the heir of the current ruler. Thus, landowners did not typically elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",
