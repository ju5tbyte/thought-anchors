  "solution": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether landowners elected their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary. I'm not super familiar with Hungarian history, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the Kingdom of Hungary was a medieval kingdom that existed from around 1000 AD until the 16th century. It was part of the Habsburg Monarchy later on, but I think the question is about the earlier period.\n\nI remember that in medieval Europe, the concept of elected rulers was more common in certain regions, like the Holy Roman Empire, where some cities and regions had more autonomy. But I'm not sure about Hungary specifically.\n\nIn the early medieval period, Hungary was established by the Magyars, who were a nomadic group that settled in the Carpathian Basin. The first kings were probably elected by some sort of council or assembly, maybe consisting of nobles or chieftains. So, in the beginning, it might have been that landowners or nobles elected the ruler.\n\nAs time went on, especially after the 13th century, the power dynamics changed. The kings started to consolidate more power, and the elective system might have become less significant. I think the Hungarian monarchy became more hereditary, with the king passing the throne to his son or another relative.\n\nThere was also the Golden Bull of 1222, which is a significant document in Hungarian history. It was a charter that limited the power of the king and granted certain rights to the nobles. This suggests that the nobles had some influence, but I'm not sure if it included the election of the ruler.\n\nWait, the Golden Bull actually established the rights of the nobility and set rules for the monarchy, but I don't recall it being about electing the king. Instead, it was more about limiting the king's powers once he was on the throne.\n\nSo, maybe in the early period, before the Golden Bull, there was some form of election by landowners or nobles. But after that, the monarchy became more hereditary, and the election process was either ceremonial or non-existent.\n\nAlso, considering that Hungary was part of the Habsburg dynasty later, which was a hereditary monarchy, it's likely that by then, the rulers were not elected but rather chosen by dynastic succession.\n\nSo putting it together, it seems that in the early Kingdom of Hungary, landowners or nobles might have elected the ruler, but over time, this practice faded, and the monarchy became hereditary. Therefore, the answer would depend on the specific time period in question. If we're talking about the early medieval period, maybe yes, but later on, probably no.\n\nBut the question is general, so I think the answer leans towards no, especially considering the later periods where the monarchy was hereditary.\n</think>\n\nIn the early Kingdom of Hungary, there was a form of elective monarchy where landowners or nobles might have elected the ruler, particularly during the establishment by the Magyars in the early medieval period.
