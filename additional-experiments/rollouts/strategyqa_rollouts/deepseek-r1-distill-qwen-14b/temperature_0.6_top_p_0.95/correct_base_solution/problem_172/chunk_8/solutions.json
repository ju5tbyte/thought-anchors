But in captivity, like zoos, they exist elsewhere. So the question is about seeing them, whether only in Africa. If you're in a zoo outside Africa, you can see them. So the answer would be no because you can see them elsewhere, just not in the wild. But the question says \"only see,\" which might mean in the wild. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Question: Can you only see hippopotamus in Africa?\n<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether you can only see hippopotamuses in Africa. Hmm, I know that hippos are big animals, but I'm not entirely sure about their range. Let me think. I remember learning that they're found in some parts of Africa, but maybe not all of it. Wait, aren't there any in other places too? I think some zoos have hippos, so they must be kept in other countries. But are there any wild populations outside of Africa? I'm pretty sure that in the past, they were found in places like Egypt, but now they're only in sub-Saharan Africa. So in the wild, they're only in Africa. But in captivity, like in zoos, they exist elsewhere. So if the question is about seeing them in general, then yes, because you can see them in zoos outside Africa. But if it's about seeing them in the wild, then no, you can't see them outside Africa. But the question is phrased as \"Can you only see hippopotamus in Africa?\" without specifying wild or captivity. So I think the answer depends on that. If it's about seeing in general, including zoos, then no, you can see them elsewhere. But if it's about wild populations, then yes, only in Africa. Wait, the question is about seeing them, not necessarily in the wild. So the answer would be no, because you can see them in zoos outside Africa. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes people think of animals only in their native habitats. I should check. Yes, hippos are native to sub-Saharan Africa, but they're kept in zoos worldwide. So the answer is no, you can see them elsewhere, just not in the wild outside Africa.\n</think>\n\nHippopotamuses are native to sub-Saharan Africa, but they are also kept in zoos and other captive environments around the world.

If you consider both wild and captivity, then no, you can see them elsewhere. But if the question is about seeing them in the wild, then yes, only in Africa. I think the question is general, so the answer would be no because they're in zoos outside Africa. But maybe the user is asking specifically about the wild. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. I should clarify that in my answer.\n</think>\n\nHippopotamuses are native to sub-Saharan Africa and are found in the wild in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Zambia. They are also kept in zoos and wildlife parks around the world, so you can see them outside of Africa in captivity. Therefore, you are not limited to seeing hippos only in Africa if you visit zoos or similar facilities.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

Question: Can you only see hippopotamus in Africa?\n<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether you can only see hippopotamuses in Africa. Hmm, I know that hippos are big animals, but I'm not entirely sure about their range. Let me think. I remember learning that they're found in some parts of Africa, but maybe not all of it. Wait, aren't there any in other places too? I think some zoos have hippos, so they must be kept in other countries. But are there any wild populations outside of Africa? I'm pretty sure that in the past, they were found in places like Egypt, but now they're only in sub-Saharan Africa. So, in the wild, yes, only Africa. But in captivity, like zoos, they're everywhere. So, if the question is about seeing them in general, the answer would be no, because you can see them in zoos outside Africa. But if it's specifically about the wild, then yes. The question doesn't specify, so I think it's asking generally. Therefore, the answer is no because you can see hippos in zoos outside Africa.\n</think>\n\nHippopotamuses are native to sub-Saharan Africa and are not found in the wild outside of this region. However, they are kept in zoos and other captive facilities around the world, so it is possible to see them in places beyond Africa.
