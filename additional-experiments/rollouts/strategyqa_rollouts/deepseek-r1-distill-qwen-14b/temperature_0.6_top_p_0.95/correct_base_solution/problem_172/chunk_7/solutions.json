I'm pretty sure that outside of Africa, hippos are only in captivity. So, in the wild, they're only in Africa. But if you include zoos and such, you can see them elsewhere. \n\nSo, the question is about seeing them, regardless of whether it's in the wild or in captivity. If someone goes to a zoo in another continent, like Asia or Europe, they can see a hippo. Therefore, you don't have to go to Africa to see one; you can see them in other places too, just not in the wild. \n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"Can you only see hippopotamus in Africa?\" So, it's asking if the only place you can see them is Africa. Since you can see them in other places in zoos, the answer would be no. You can see them outside Africa, just not in the wild. So, the answer is no, you can see them elsewhere, though not in the wild.\n</think>\n\nHippopotamuses are native to Africa, but they can also be found in captivity outside of Africa, such as in zoos.

Hmm, I know that hippos are big animals, but I'm not entirely sure about their range. Let me think. I remember learning that they're found in some parts of Africa, but maybe not all of it. Wait, aren't there any in other places too? I think some zoos have hippos, so they must be kept in other countries. But are there any wild populations outside of Africa? I'm not sure. I recall that hippos were once in the Middle East, like in Israel or something, but maybe they're not there anymore. So, if you go to a zoo in Asia, Europe, or the Americas, you can see hippos, but those are in captivity. In the wild, they're only in Africa. So, the answer depends on whether you're considering captivity or not. The question says \"see,\" which could include zoos. Therefore, you can see them outside Africa, but only in captivity. So, the answer would be no, you can see them elsewhere, just not in the wild.\n</think>\n\nHippopotamuses are native to parts of Africa, but they can also be found in captivity in other regions such as zoos in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Therefore, while wild hippos are only in Africa, you can see them outside of Africa in zoos. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",

Maybe in Asia or Europe? I don't recall hearing about wild hippos in places like that. So, perhaps the only place where they live in the wild is Africa. But then, in captivity, like zoos, they're found all over the world. So the answer would depend on whether the question is about wild or captive animals. If it's about seeing them anywhere, including zoos, then no, you can see them elsewhere. But if it's specifically about the wild, then yes, only Africa. The question doesn't specify, so I think it's about seeing them in general. So the answer would be no, because you can see them in zoos outside Africa.
