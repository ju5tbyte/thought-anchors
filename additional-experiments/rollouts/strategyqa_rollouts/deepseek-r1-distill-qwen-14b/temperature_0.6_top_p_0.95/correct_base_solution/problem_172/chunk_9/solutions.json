Question: Can you only see hippopotamus in Africa?\n<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether you can only see hippopotamuses in Africa. Hmm, I know that hippos are big animals, but I'm not entirely sure about their range. Let me think. I remember learning that they're found in some parts of Africa, but maybe not all of it. Wait, aren't there any in other places too? I think some zoos have hippos, so they must be kept in other countries. But are there any wild populations outside of Africa? I'm pretty sure that in the past, they were found in places like Egypt, but now they're only in sub-Saharan Africa. So in the wild, yes, only Africa. But in captivity, like zoos, they're all over the world. So the question is about seeing them in general, not just in the wild. If someone goes to a zoo, they can see a hippo even if they're not in Africa. So the answer would be no, because you can see them outside of Africa, just not in the wild. But wait, the question says \"Can you only see hippopotamus in Africa?\" If you interpret it as seeing them in the wild, then yes, only Africa.

Wait, aren't there any in other places too? I think some zoos have hippos, so they must be kept in other countries. But are there any wild populations outside of Africa? I'm pretty sure that in the past, they were found in places like Egypt, but now they're only in sub-Saharan Africa. So in the wild, yes, only Africa. But in captivity, like zoos, they exist elsewhere. So the question is, can you only see them in Africa? If the question is about seeing them in the wild, then yes, only Africa. But if it's about seeing them anywhere, including zoos, then no, because you can see them elsewhere. Wait, the question is phrased as \"Can you only see hippopotamus in Africa?\" which might mean in general, not necessarily in the wild. So I think the answer is no because they're also in zoos outside Africa. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes people mean in the wild. I should probably clarify, but since the question doesn't specify, I'll assume it's about seeing them anywhere. So the answer would be no, you can see them in other places like zoos.\n</think>\n\nHippopotamuses are native to sub-Saharan Africa and are found in the wild there. However, they are also kept in zoos and other captive environments outside of Africa. Therefore, you can see hippopotamuses in places other than Africa, such as zoos around the world.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",
