I'm pretty sure that in the past, they were found in places like Egypt, but now they're only in sub-Saharan Africa. So in the wild, yes, only Africa. But in captivity, like zoos, they exist elsewhere. So the question is about seeing them, whether it's only in Africa. If someone is talking about seeing them in the wild, then yes, only Africa. But if they include zoos, then no, because you can see them elsewhere. The question doesn't specify, so I might need to clarify. But generally, when people think of seeing animals, they might mean in the wild.

But usually, when people ask if you can only see something in a place, they might mean in the wild. So, considering that, yes, you can only see wild hippos in Africa.

Question: Can you only see hippopotamus in Africa?\n<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether you can only see hippopotamuses in Africa. Hmm, I know that hippos are big animals, but I'm not entirely sure about their range. Let me think. I remember learning that they're found in some parts of Africa, but maybe not all of it. Wait, aren't there any in other places too? I think some zoos have hippos, so they must be kept in other countries. But are there any wild populations outside of Africa? I'm pretty sure that in the past, they were found in places like Egypt, but now they're only in sub-Saharan Africa. So in the wild, yes, only Africa. But in captivity, like zoos, they exist elsewhere. So if the question is about seeing them in general, the answer would be no, because you can see them in zoos outside Africa. But if it's about seeing them in the wild, then yes, only Africa. But the question says \"see,\" which could include both wild and captivity. So maybe the answer is no because you can see them in other places, just not in the wild.\n</think>\n\nHippopotamuses are native to sub-Saharan Africa, where they can be found in the wild. However, they are also kept in zoos and other captive environments around the world, allowing people to see them outside of Africa. Therefore, you can see hippopotamuses in places other than Africa, though not in the wild.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

But the question is phrased as \"Can you only see hippopotamus in Africa?\" So it's asking if you can only see them there, meaning everywhere else you can't. But since zoos have them, you can see them elsewhere. So the answer would be no, you can see them outside Africa, just not in the wild. So the answer is no.\n</think>\n\nHippopotamuses are native to sub-Saharan Africa and are found in the wild there. However, they are also kept in zoos and other captive environments around the world. Therefore, it is possible to see hippopotamuses outside of Africa, though not in the wild. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",
