  "source_text": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Can you only see hippopotamus in Africa?\n<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether you can only see hippopotamuses in Africa. Hmm, I know that hippos are big animals, but I'm not entirely sure about their range. Let me think. I remember learning that they're found in some parts of Africa, but maybe not all of it. Wait, aren't there any in other places too? I think some zoos have hippos, so they must be kept in other countries. But are there any wild populations outside of Africa? I'm pretty sure that in the past, they were found in places like Egypt, but now they're only in sub-Saharan Africa. So in the wild, yes, only Africa. But in captivity, like zoos, they exist elsewhere. So if the question is about seeing them in general, including zoos, then the answer would be no, because you can see them in other places. But if it's only about seeing them in the wild, then yes, only Africa. The question doesn't specify, so I think it's about seeing them in general. So the answer should be no because they're also in zoos outside Africa.\n</think>\n\nHippopotamuses are native to sub-Saharan Africa and are found in the wild there. However, they are also kept in zoos and other captive environments around the world. Therefore, you can see hippopotamuses outside of Africa, particularly in zoos. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",
