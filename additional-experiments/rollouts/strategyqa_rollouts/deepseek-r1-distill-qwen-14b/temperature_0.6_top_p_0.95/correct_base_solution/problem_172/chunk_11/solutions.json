Hmm, I know that hippos are big animals, but I'm not entirely sure about their range. Let me think. I remember learning that they're found in some parts of Africa, but maybe not all of it. Wait, aren't there any in other places too? I think some zoos have hippos, so they must be kept in other countries. But are there any wild populations outside of Africa? I'm pretty sure that in the past, they were found in places like Egypt, but now they're only in sub-Saharan Africa. So in the wild, yes, only Africa. But in captivity, like zoos, they exist elsewhere. So if the question is about seeing them in general, including zoos, then the answer would be no, because you can see them in other places.

Question: Can you only see hippopotamus in Africa?\n<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether you can only see hippopotamuses in Africa. Hmm, I know that hippos are big animals, but I'm not entirely sure about their range. Let me think. I remember learning that they're found in some parts of Africa, but maybe not all of it. Wait, aren't there any in other places too? I think some zoos have hippos, so they must be kept in other countries. But are there any wild populations outside of Africa? I'm pretty sure that in the past, they were found in places like Egypt, but now they're only in sub-Saharan Africa. So in the wild, yes, only Africa.
