Question: Is Olympia, Washington part of \"Ish river country\"?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Olympia, Washington is part of \"Ish river country.\" Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what \"Ish river country\" refers to. Maybe it's a typo? Let me think. I've heard of the \"Inland Empire,\" which is a term used for parts of Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho, but that's not \"Ish river.\" Maybe it's a local term or something I'm not familiar with. I know Olympia is the capital of Washington state, located in the Puget Sound region. The Puget Sound area is known for its many rivers, like the Snohomish, the Duwamish, and the Nisqually. Wait, there's also the Chehalis River. Could \"Ish river\" be referring to the Chehalis? Sometimes names get changed or misheard, so maybe that's the case. If \"Ish river country\" is a local term for the area around the Chehalis River, then Olympia might be near it. Let me check a map. Olympia is in Thurston County, and the Chehalis River flows through Lewis and Grays Harbor Counties, but it's nearby. So perhaps the term is used colloquially in that region. Alternatively, maybe \"Ish river\" is a less common name for another river nearby. I'm not entirely certain, but based on the proximity and possible name variations, it's possible that Olympia is part of \"Ish river country.\"\n</think>\n\nOlympia, Washington, is located in the Puget Sound region and is near the Chehalis River. The term \"Ish river country\" might refer to the area around the Chehalis River, making Olympia part of it. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",
