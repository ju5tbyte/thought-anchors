I've heard of the \"Inland Empire,\" which is a term used for parts of Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho, but that's not \"Ish river.\" Maybe it's a local term or something I'm not familiar with. I know Olympia is the capital of Washington state, located in the Puget Sound region. The Puget Sound area is known for its many rivers, like the Snohomish, the Duwamish, and the Nisqually. Wait, there's also the Chehalis River. Could \"Ish river\" be referring to the Chehalis? Sometimes names get changed or misheard, so maybe that's the case. If \"Ish river country\" is a local term for the area around the Chehalis River, then Olympia might be near it. Let me check a map. Olympia is in Thurston County, and the Chehalis River flows through Lewis and Grays Harbor Counties, but it's nearby. So perhaps the term is used colloquially in that region. Alternatively, maybe \"Ish river\" is a smaller, less-known river. I should consider that possibility too. But given the proximity of Olympia to the Chehalis River and the common mishearing of names, it's plausible that \"Ish river country\" refers to the area around the Chehalis, making Olympia part of it. So, yes, I think Olympia is part of \"Ish river country\" in this context.\n</think>\n\nOlympia, Washington, is located in the Puget Sound region and is near the Chehalis River. The term \"Ish river country\" likely refers to the area around the Chehalis River, given possible name misinterpretations. Therefore, Olympia is part of \"Ish river country.\"\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Wait, there's also the Chehalis River. Could \"Ish river\" be referring to the Chehalis? Sometimes names get changed or misheard, so maybe that's the case. If \"Ish river country\" is a local term for the area around the Chehalis River, then Olympia might be near it. Let me check a map. Olympia is in Thurston County, and the Chehalis River flows through Lewis and Grays Harbor Counties, but it's nearby. So perhaps the term is used colloquially in that region. Alternatively, maybe \"Ish river\" is a smaller, less-known river. I should consider that possibility too. If it's a smaller river, maybe it's part of a specific area near Olympia. But without more context, it's hard to be certain. Given that Olympia is a significant city in Washington, it's possible that it's part of a regional designation, even if it's not widely recognized.
