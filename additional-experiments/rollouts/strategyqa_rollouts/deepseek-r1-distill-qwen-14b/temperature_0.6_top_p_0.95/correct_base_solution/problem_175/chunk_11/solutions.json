If \"Ish river country\" is a local term for the area around the Chehalis River, then Olympia might be near it. Let me check a map. Olympia is south of Seattle, near the Olympic Peninsula. The Chehalis River flows through areas like Chehalis and Hoquiam, which are a bit north of Olympia. So, Olympia is in Thurston County, and the Chehalis River is in neighboring counties. Maybe they're close enough that Olympia is considered part of the \"Ish river country\" if that's a regional term. Alternatively, \"Ish river\" could be a mishearing of \"Chehalis.\" If that's the case, then yes, Olympia is in the vicinity of the Chehalis River, so it might fall under that area. I'm not 100% certain, but based on the geographical proximity and possible name variations, I think the answer is yes.\n</think>\n\nOlympia, Washington, is located in the Puget Sound region and is near the Chehalis River, which might be referred to as the \"Ish river\" in some contexts.
