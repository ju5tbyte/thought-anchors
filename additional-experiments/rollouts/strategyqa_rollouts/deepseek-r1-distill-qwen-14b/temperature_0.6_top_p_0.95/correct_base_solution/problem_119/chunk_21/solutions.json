    "prefix_without_chunk": "Alright, let's tackle this question: \"Has Oscar Wilde's most famous character ever been in an Eva Green project?\" First, I need to identify who Oscar Wilde is and what his most famous character is. Oscar Wilde was a renowned Irish playwright, novelist, and poet in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His most famous works include \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" \"An Ideal Husband,\" and \"The Importance of Being Earnest.\" The main character from \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is Dorian Gray himself. Next, I should figure out if Dorian Gray has been portrayed in any project that Eva Green has been involved in. Eva Green is a French actress known for her roles in films like \"Casino Royale,\" \"The Witch,\" and \"Artemis Fowl.\" She's also been in some television series and shorter projects. I'll start by recalling Eva Green's filmography. One of her notable roles was as Vesper Lynd in the 2006 James Bond film \"Casino Royale.\" Another significant role was in the psychological horror film \"The Witch\" (2015), where she played the title character. She also starred in \"Artemis Fowl\" (2020), based on the popular book series. Now, I need to check if any of these projects or others she's been in have involved the character Dorian Gray. \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has been adapted into various films and TV series over the years. For instance, there was a 1999 film adaptation starring James Marsters as Dorian Gray, and a 2009 version with Ben Barnes in the lead role. There's also a TV series titled \"Penny Dreadful,\" which includes a character named Dorian Gray, portrayed by Reeve Carney in the first season and later by Rory Kinnear. Looking at Eva Green's involvement, she starred in \"Penny Dreadful\" as Dr. Seward. In that series, Dorian Gray is a significant character, but Eva Green's role was separate. She didn't portray Dorian Gray herself. Therefore, while she was in the same project where Dorian Gray appeared, she didn't play the character. Additionally, I'll consider other projects. There's a musical adaptation of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" but I don't recall Eva Green being part of that. Other adaptations, such as the 1986 TV movie, don't feature her either. So, putting it all together: Oscar Wilde's most famous character is Dorian Gray.",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Alright, let's tackle this question: \"Has Oscar Wilde's most famous character ever been in an Eva Green project?\" First, I need to identify who Oscar Wilde is and what his most famous character is. Oscar Wilde was a renowned Irish playwright, novelist, and poet in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His most famous works include \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" \"An Ideal Husband,\" and \"The Importance of Being Earnest.\" The main character from \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is Dorian Gray himself. Next, I should figure out if Dorian Gray has been portrayed in any project that Eva Green has been involved in. Eva Green is a French actress known for her roles in films like \"Casino Royale,\" \"The Witch,\" and \"Artemis Fowl.\" She's also been in some television series and shorter projects. I'll start by recalling Eva Green's filmography. One of her notable roles was as Vesper Lynd in the 2006 James Bond film \"Casino Royale.\" Another significant role was in the psychological horror film \"The Witch\" (2015), where she played the title character. She also starred in \"Artemis Fowl\" (2020), based on the popular book series. Now, I need to check if any of these projects or others she's been in have involved the character Dorian Gray. \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has been adapted into various films and TV series over the years. For instance, there was a 1999 film adaptation starring James Marsters as Dorian Gray, and a 2009 version with Ben Barnes in the lead role. There's also a TV series titled \"Penny Dreadful,\" which includes a character named Dorian Gray, portrayed by Reeve Carney in the first season and later by Rory Kinnear. Looking at Eva Green's involvement, she starred in \"Penny Dreadful\" as Dr. Seward. In that series, Dorian Gray is a significant character, but Eva Green's role was separate. She didn't portray Dorian Gray herself. Therefore, while she was in the same project where Dorian Gray appeared, she didn't play the character. Additionally, I'll consider other projects. There's a musical adaptation of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" but I don't recall Eva Green being part of that. Other adaptations, such as the 1986 TV movie, don't feature her either. So, putting it all together: Oscar Wilde's most famous character is Dorian Gray.",

Oscar Wilde was a renowned Irish playwright, novelist, and poet in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His most famous works include \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" \"An Ideal Husband,\" and \"The Importance of Being Earnest.\" The main character from \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is Dorian Gray himself. Next, I should figure out if Dorian Gray has been portrayed in any project that Eva Green has been involved in. Eva Green is a French actress known for her roles in films like \"Casino Royale,\" \"The Witch,\" and \"Artemis Fowl.\" She's also been in some television series and shorter projects. I'll start by recalling Eva Green's filmography. One of her notable roles was as Vesper Lynd in the 2006 James Bond film \"Casino Royale.\" Another significant role was in the psychological horror film \"The Witch\" (2015), where she played the title character. She also starred in \"Artemis Fowl\" (2020), based on the popular book series. Now, I need to check if any of these projects or others she's been in have involved the character Dorian Gray. \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has been adapted into various films and TV series over the years. For instance, there was a 1999 film adaptation starring James Marsters as Dorian Gray, and a 2009 version with Ben Barnes in the lead role. There's also a TV series titled \"Penny Dreadful,\" which includes a character named Dorian Gray, portrayed by Reeve Carney in the first season and later by Rory Kinnear. Looking at Eva Green's involvement, she starred in \"Penny Dreadful\" as Dr. Seward. In that series, Dorian Gray is a significant character, but Eva Green's role was separate. She didn't portray Dorian Gray herself. Therefore, while she was in the same project where Dorian Gray appeared, she didn't play the character. Additionally, I'll consider other projects. There's a musical adaptation of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" but I don't recall Eva Green being part of that. Other adaptations, such as the 1986 TV movie, don't feature her either.

However, she was in \"Penny Dreadful,\" where Dorian Gray was a character. The question is whether the character has been in a project she was part of. Since \"Penny Dreadful\" is one of her projects and Dorian Gray was in it, the answer would be yes. Wait, but the question is phrased as \"Has Oscar Wilde's most famous character ever been in an Eva Green project?\" So, it's asking if the character Dorian Gray has been in a project that Eva Green has been part of. Since Eva Green was in \"Penny Dreadful,\" and Dorian Gray was in that same project, the answer is yes. However, it's important to clarify that Eva Green didn't play Dorian Gray herself, but the character was present in a project she was part of. So, the answer should be yes because the character was in the same project Eva Green was involved in.\n</think>\n\nEva Green starred in the TV series \"Penny Dreadful,\" where Dorian Gray was a character portrayed by Reeve Carney and later Rory Kinnear.

His most famous works include \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" \"An Ideal Husband,\" and \"The Importance of Being Earnest.\" The main character from \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is Dorian Gray himself. Next, I should figure out if Dorian Gray has been portrayed in any project that Eva Green has been involved in. Eva Green is a French actress known for her roles in films like \"Casino Royale,\" \"The Witch,\" and \"Artemis Fowl.\" She's also been in some television series and shorter projects. I'll start by recalling Eva Green's filmography. One of her notable roles was as Vesper Lynd in the 2006 James Bond film \"Casino Royale.\" Another significant role was in the psychological horror film \"The Witch\" (2015), where she played the title character. She also starred in \"Artemis Fowl\" (2020), based on the popular book series. Now, I need to check if any of these projects or others she's been in have involved the character Dorian Gray. \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has been adapted into various films and TV series over the years. For instance, there was a 1999 film adaptation starring James Marsters as Dorian Gray, and a 2009 version with Ben Barnes in the lead role. There's also a TV series titled \"Penny Dreadful,\" which includes a character named Dorian Gray, portrayed by Reeve Carney in the first season and later by Rory Kinnear. Looking at Eva Green's involvement, she starred in \"Penny Dreadful\" as Dr. Seward. In that series, Dorian Gray is a significant character, but Eva Green's role was separate. She didn't portray Dorian Gray herself. Therefore, while she was in the same project where Dorian Gray appeared, she didn't play the character. Additionally, I'll consider other projects. There's a musical adaptation of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" but I don't recall Eva Green being part of that. Other adaptations, such as the 1986 TV movie, don't feature her either. So, putting it all together: Oscar Wilde's most famous character is Dorian Gray. Eva Green has been in projects where Dorian Gray appears, like \"Penny Dreadful,\" but she didn't play the character herself. The question is whether Dorian Gray has been in an Eva Green project. If it's asking if Eva Green has portrayed Dorian Gray, the answer is no. However, if it's asking if Dorian Gray has been in a project Eva Green has been part of, then yes, as she was in \"Penny Dreadful\" where Dorian Gray was a character. But since the question is phrased as \"ever been in an Eva Green project,\" it might be interpreted as whether Dorian Gray has been in a project Eva Green has been in, not necessarily her playing the character. However, given the way the question is phrased, it's more likely asking if Eva Green has played Dorian Gray. Since she hasn't, the answer would be no. But to be thorough, I should clarify the exact phrasing. The question is: \"Has Oscar Wilde's most famous character ever been in an Eva Green project?\" So, it's asking if Dorian Gray has been in a project that Eva Green has been part of. Since Eva Green was in \"Penny Dreadful,\" where Dorian Gray is a character, the answer would be yes. However, if the question is whether Eva Green has played Dorian Gray, the answer is no. Given the phrasing, it's about Dorian Gray being in a project Eva Green was in, so the answer is yes. But I'm a bit confused because usually, such questions imply whether the actor/actress has portrayed the character. To resolve this, I'll stick to the literal interpretation: has Dorian Gray been in any project Eva Green has been part of. Since \"Penny Dreadful\" features both Eva Green and Dorian Gray, the answer is yes.\n</think>\n\nEva Green has starred in the TV series \"Penny Dreadful,\" where Dorian Gray is a character portrayed by Reeve Carney and later by Rory Kinnear. While she was part of the same project, she did not portray Dorian Gray herself. Therefore, Oscar Wilde's most famous character, Dorian Gray, has been in a project that Eva Green was part of, but she did not play the character. \n\nHowever, based on the phrasing of the question, it asks if Dorian Gray has ever been in an Eva Green project, which he has, as Eva Green was in \"Penny Dreadful\" where Dorian Gray appears. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Oscar Wilde was a renowned Irish playwright, novelist, and poet in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His most famous works include \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" \"An Ideal Husband,\" and \"The Importance of Being Earnest.\" The main character from \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is Dorian Gray himself. Next, I should figure out if Dorian Gray has been portrayed in any project that Eva Green has been involved in. Eva Green is a French actress known for her roles in films like \"Casino Royale,\" \"The Witch,\" and \"Artemis Fowl.\" She's also been in some television series and shorter projects. I'll start by recalling Eva Green's filmography. One of her notable roles was as Vesper Lynd in the 2006 James Bond film \"Casino Royale.\" Another significant role was in the psychological horror film \"The Witch\" (2015), where she played the title character. She also starred in \"Artemis Fowl\" (2020), based on the popular book series. Now, I need to check if any of these projects or others she's been in have involved the character Dorian Gray. \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has been adapted into various films and TV series over the years. For instance, there was a 1999 film adaptation starring James Marsters as Dorian Gray, and a 2009 version with Ben Barnes in the lead role. There's also a TV series titled \"Penny Dreadful,\" which includes a character named Dorian Gray, portrayed by Reeve Carney in the first season and later by Rory Kinnear. Looking at Eva Green's involvement, she starred in \"Penny Dreadful\" as Dr. Seward. In that series, Dorian Gray is a significant character, but Eva Green's role was separate. She didn't portray Dorian Gray herself. Therefore, while she was in the same project where Dorian Gray appeared, she didn't play the character. Additionally, I'll consider other projects. There's a musical adaptation of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" but I don't recall Eva Green being part of that. Other adaptations, such as the 1986 TV movie, don't feature her either.

For instance, there was a 1999 film adaptation starring James Marsters as Dorian Gray, and a 2009 version with Ben Barnes in the lead role. There's also a TV series titled \"Penny Dreadful,\" which includes a character named Dorian Gray, portrayed by Reeve Carney in the first season and later by Rory Kinnear. Looking at Eva Green's involvement, she starred in \"Penny Dreadful\" as Dr. Seward. In that series, Dorian Gray is a significant character, but Eva Green's role was separate. She didn't portray Dorian Gray herself. Therefore, while she was in the same project where Dorian Gray appeared, she didn't play the character. Additionally, I'll consider other projects. There's a musical adaptation of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" but I don't recall Eva Green being part of that. Other adaptations, such as the 1986 TV movie, don't feature her either.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Alright, let's tackle this question: \"Has Oscar Wilde's most famous character ever been in an Eva Green project?\" First, I need to identify who Oscar Wilde is and what his most famous character is. Oscar Wilde was a renowned Irish playwright, novelist, and poet in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His most famous works include \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" \"An Ideal Husband,\" and \"The Importance of Being Earnest.\" The main character from \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is Dorian Gray himself. Next, I should figure out if Dorian Gray has been portrayed in any project that Eva Green has been involved in. Eva Green is a French actress known for her roles in films like \"Casino Royale,\" \"The Witch,\" and \"Artemis Fowl.\" She's also been in some television series and shorter projects. I'll start by recalling Eva Green's filmography. One of her notable roles was as Vesper Lynd in the 2006 James Bond film \"Casino Royale.\" Another significant role was in the psychological horror film \"The Witch\" (2015), where she played the title character. She also starred in \"Artemis Fowl\" (2020), based on the popular book series. Now, I need to check if any of these projects or others she's been in have involved the character Dorian Gray. \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has been adapted into various films and TV series over the years. For instance, there was a 1999 film adaptation starring James Marsters as Dorian Gray, and a 2009 version with Ben Barnes in the lead role. There's also a TV series titled \"Penny Dreadful,\" which includes a character named Dorian Gray, portrayed by Reeve Carney in the first season and later by Rory Kinnear. Looking at Eva Green's involvement, she starred in \"Penny Dreadful\" as Dr. Seward. In that series, Dorian Gray is a significant character, but Eva Green's role was separate. She didn't portray Dorian Gray herself. Therefore, while she was in the same project where Dorian Gray appeared, she didn't play the character. Additionally, I'll consider other projects. There's a musical adaptation of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" but I don't recall Eva Green being part of that. Other adaptations, such as the 1986 TV movie, don't feature her either. So, putting it all together: Oscar Wilde's most famous character is Dorian Gray.",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Alright, let's tackle this question: \"Has Oscar Wilde's most famous character ever been in an Eva Green project?\" First, I need to identify who Oscar Wilde is and what his most famous character is. Oscar Wilde was a renowned Irish playwright, novelist, and poet in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His most famous works include \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" \"An Ideal Husband,\" and \"The Importance of Being Earnest.\" The main character from \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is Dorian Gray himself. Next, I should figure out if Dorian Gray has been portrayed in any project that Eva Green has been involved in. Eva Green is a French actress known for her roles in films like \"Casino Royale,\" \"The Witch,\" and \"Artemis Fowl.\" She's also been in some television series and shorter projects. I'll start by recalling Eva Green's filmography. One of her notable roles was as Vesper Lynd in the 2006 James Bond film \"Casino Royale.\" Another significant role was in the psychological horror film \"The Witch\" (2015), where she played the title character. She also starred in \"Artemis Fowl\" (2020), based on the popular book series. Now, I need to check if any of these projects or others she's been in have involved the character Dorian Gray. \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has been adapted into various films and TV series over the years. For instance, there was a 1999 film adaptation starring James Marsters as Dorian Gray, and a 2009 version with Ben Barnes in the lead role. There's also a TV series titled \"Penny Dreadful,\" which includes a character named Dorian Gray, portrayed by Reeve Carney in the first season and later by Rory Kinnear. Looking at Eva Green's involvement, she starred in \"Penny Dreadful\" as Dr. Seward. In that series, Dorian Gray is a significant character, but Eva Green's role was separate. She didn't portray Dorian Gray herself. Therefore, while she was in the same project where Dorian Gray appeared, she didn't play the character. Additionally, I'll consider other projects. There's a musical adaptation of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" but I don't recall Eva Green being part of that. Other adaptations, such as the 1986 TV movie, don't feature her either.

Eva Green is a French actress known for her roles in films like \"Casino Royale,\" \"The Witch,\" and \"Artemis Fowl.\" She's also been in some television series and shorter projects. I'll start by recalling Eva Green's filmography. One of her notable roles was as Vesper Lynd in the 2006 James Bond film \"Casino Royale.\" Another significant role was in the psychological horror film \"The Witch\" (2015), where she played the title character. She also starred in \"Artemis Fowl\" (2020), based on the popular book series. Now, I need to check if any of these projects or others she's been in have involved the character Dorian Gray. \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has been adapted into various films and TV series over the years. For instance, there was a 1999 film adaptation starring James Marsters as Dorian Gray, and a 2009 version with Ben Barnes in the lead role. There's also a TV series titled \"Penny Dreadful,\" which includes a character named Dorian Gray, portrayed by Reeve Carney in the first season and later by Rory Kinnear. Looking at Eva Green's involvement, she starred in \"Penny Dreadful\" as Dr. Seward. In that series, Dorian Gray is a significant character, but Eva Green's role was separate. She didn't portray Dorian Gray herself. Therefore, while she was in the same project where Dorian Gray appeared, she didn't play the character. Additionally, I'll consider other projects. There's a musical adaptation of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" but I don't recall Eva Green being part of that. Other adaptations, such as the 1986 TV movie, don't feature her either. So, putting it all together: Oscar Wilde's most famous character is Dorian Gray.",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Alright, let's tackle this question: \"Has Oscar Wilde's most famous character ever been in an Eva Green project?\" First, I need to identify who Oscar Wilde is and what his most famous character is. Oscar Wilde was a renowned Irish playwright, novelist, and poet in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His most famous works include \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" \"An Ideal Husband,\" and \"The Importance of Being Earnest.\" The main character from \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is Dorian Gray himself. Next, I should figure out if Dorian Gray has been portrayed in any project that Eva Green has been involved in. Eva Green is a French actress known for her roles in films like \"Casino Royale,\" \"The Witch,\" and \"Artemis Fowl.\" She's also been in some television series and shorter projects. I'll start by recalling Eva Green's filmography. One of her notable roles was as Vesper Lynd in the 2006 James Bond film \"Casino Royale.\" Another significant role was in the psychological horror film \"The Witch\" (2015), where she played the title character. She also starred in \"Artemis Fowl\" (2020), based on the popular book series. Now, I need to check if any of these projects or others she's been in have involved the character Dorian Gray. \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has been adapted into various films and TV series over the years. For instance, there was a 1999 film adaptation starring James Marsters as Dorian Gray, and a 2009 version with Ben Barnes in the lead role. There's also a TV series titled \"Penny Dreadful,\" which includes a character named Dorian Gray, portrayed by Reeve Carney in the first season and later by Rory Kinnear. Looking at Eva Green's involvement, she starred in \"Penny Dreadful\" as Dr. Seward. In that series, Dorian Gray is a significant character, but Eva Green's role was separate. She didn't portray Dorian Gray herself. Therefore, while she was in the same project where Dorian Gray appeared, she didn't play the character. Additionally, I'll consider other projects. There's a musical adaptation of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" but I don't recall Eva Green being part of that. Other adaptations, such as the 1986 TV movie, don't feature her either. So, putting it all together: Oscar Wilde's most famous character is Dorian Gray.",

Oscar Wilde was a renowned Irish playwright, novelist, and poet in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His most famous works include \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" \"An Ideal Husband,\" and \"The Importance of Being Earnest.\" The main character from \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is Dorian Gray himself. Next, I should figure out if Dorian Gray has been portrayed in any project that Eva Green has been involved in. Eva Green is a French actress known for her roles in films like \"Casino Royale,\" \"The Witch,\" and \"Artemis Fowl.\" She's also been in some television series and shorter projects. I'll start by recalling Eva Green's filmography. One of her notable roles was as Vesper Lynd in the 2006 James Bond film \"Casino Royale.\" Another significant role was in the psychological horror film \"The Witch\" (2015), where she played the title character. She also starred in \"Artemis Fowl\" (2020), based on the popular book series. Now, I need to check if any of these projects or others she's been in have involved the character Dorian Gray. \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has been adapted into various films and TV series over the years. For instance, there was a 1999 film adaptation starring James Marsters as Dorian Gray, and a 2009 version with Ben Barnes in the lead role. There's also a TV series titled \"Penny Dreadful,\" which includes a character named Dorian Gray, portrayed by Reeve Carney in the first season and later by Rory Kinnear. Looking at Eva Green's involvement, she starred in \"Penny Dreadful\" as Dr. Seward. In that series, Dorian Gray is a significant character, but Eva Green's role was separate. She didn't portray Dorian Gray herself. Therefore, while she was in the same project where Dorian Gray appeared, she didn't play the character. Additionally, I'll consider other projects. There's a musical adaptation of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" but I don't recall Eva Green being part of that. Other adaptations, such as the 1986 TV movie, don't feature her either.

Next, I should figure out if Dorian Gray has been portrayed in any project that Eva Green has been involved in. Eva Green is a French actress known for her roles in films like \"Casino Royale,\" \"The Witch,\" and \"Artemis Fowl.\" She's also been in some television series and shorter projects. I'll start by recalling Eva Green's filmography. One of her notable roles was as Vesper Lynd in the 2006 James Bond film \"Casino Royale.\" Another significant role was in the psychological horror film \"The Witch\" (2015), where she played the title character. She also starred in \"Artemis Fowl\" (2020), based on the popular book series. Now, I need to check if any of these projects or others she's been in have involved the character Dorian Gray. \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has been adapted into various films and TV series over the years. For instance, there was a 1999 film adaptation starring James Marsters as Dorian Gray, and a 2009 version with Ben Barnes in the lead role. There's also a TV series titled \"Penny Dreadful,\" which includes a character named Dorian Gray, portrayed by Reeve Carney in the first season and later by Rory Kinnear. Looking at Eva Green's involvement, she starred in \"Penny Dreadful\" as Dr. Seward. In that series, Dorian Gray is a significant character, but Eva Green's role was separate. She didn't portray Dorian Gray herself. Therefore, while she was in the same project where Dorian Gray appeared, she didn't play the character. Additionally, I'll consider other projects. There's a musical adaptation of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" but I don't recall Eva Green being part of that. Other adaptations, such as the 1986 TV movie, don't feature her either.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Alright, let's tackle this question: \"Has Oscar Wilde's most famous character ever been in an Eva Green project?\" First, I need to identify who Oscar Wilde is and what his most famous character is. Oscar Wilde was a renowned Irish playwright, novelist, and poet in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His most famous works include \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" \"An Ideal Husband,\" and \"The Importance of Being Earnest.\" The main character from \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is Dorian Gray himself. Next, I should figure out if Dorian Gray has been portrayed in any project that Eva Green has been involved in. Eva Green is a French actress known for her roles in films like \"Casino Royale,\" \"The Witch,\" and \"Artemis Fowl.\" She's also been in some television series and shorter projects. I'll start by recalling Eva Green's filmography. One of her notable roles was as Vesper Lynd in the 2006 James Bond film \"Casino Royale.\" Another significant role was in the psychological horror film \"The Witch\" (2015), where she played the title character. She also starred in \"Artemis Fowl\" (2020), based on the popular book series. Now, I need to check if any of these projects or others she's been in have involved the character Dorian Gray. \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has been adapted into various films and TV series over the years. For instance, there was a 1999 film adaptation starring James Marsters as Dorian Gray, and a 2009 version with Ben Barnes in the lead role. There's also a TV series titled \"Penny Dreadful,\" which includes a character named Dorian Gray, portrayed by Reeve Carney in the first season and later by Rory Kinnear. Looking at Eva Green's involvement, she starred in \"Penny Dreadful\" as Dr. Seward. In that series, Dorian Gray is a significant character, but Eva Green's role was separate. She didn't portray Dorian Gray herself. Therefore, while she was in the same project where Dorian Gray appeared, she didn't play the character. Additionally, I'll consider other projects. There's a musical adaptation of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" but I don't recall Eva Green being part of that. Other adaptations, such as the 1986 TV movie, don't feature her either.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Alright, let's tackle this question: \"Has Oscar Wilde's most famous character ever been in an Eva Green project?\" First, I need to identify who Oscar Wilde is and what his most famous character is. Oscar Wilde was a renowned Irish playwright, novelist, and poet in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His most famous works include \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" \"An Ideal Husband,\" and \"The Importance of Being Earnest.\" The main character from \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is Dorian Gray himself. Next, I should figure out if Dorian Gray has been portrayed in any project that Eva Green has been involved in. Eva Green is a French actress known for her roles in films like \"Casino Royale,\" \"The Witch,\" and \"Artemis Fowl.\" She's also been in some television series and shorter projects. I'll start by recalling Eva Green's filmography. One of her notable roles was as Vesper Lynd in the 2006 James Bond film \"Casino Royale.\" Another significant role was in the psychological horror film \"The Witch\" (2015), where she played the title character. She also starred in \"Artemis Fowl\" (2020), based on the popular book series. Now, I need to check if any of these projects or others she's been in have involved the character Dorian Gray. \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has been adapted into various films and TV series over the years. For instance, there was a 1999 film adaptation starring James Marsters as Dorian Gray, and a 2009 version with Ben Barnes in the lead role. There's also a TV series titled \"Penny Dreadful,\" which includes a character named Dorian Gray, portrayed by Reeve Carney in the first season and later by Rory Kinnear. Looking at Eva Green's involvement, she starred in \"Penny Dreadful\" as Dr. Seward. In that series, Dorian Gray is a significant character, but Eva Green's role was separate. She didn't portray Dorian Gray herself. Therefore, while she was in the same project where Dorian Gray appeared, she didn't play the character. Additionally, I'll consider other projects. There's a musical adaptation of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" but I don't recall Eva Green being part of that. Other adaptations, such as the 1986 TV movie, don't feature her either. So, putting it all together: Oscar Wilde's most famous character is Dorian Gray.",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Alright, let's tackle this question: \"Has Oscar Wilde's most famous character ever been in an Eva Green project?\" First, I need to identify who Oscar Wilde is and what his most famous character is. Oscar Wilde was a renowned Irish playwright, novelist, and poet in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His most famous works include \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" \"An Ideal Husband,\" and \"The Importance of Being Earnest.\" The main character from \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is Dorian Gray himself. Next, I should figure out if Dorian Gray has been portrayed in any project that Eva Green has been involved in. Eva Green is a French actress known for her roles in films like \"Casino Royale,\" \"The Witch,\" and \"Artemis Fowl.\" She's also been in some television series and shorter projects. I'll start by recalling Eva Green's filmography. One of her notable roles was as Vesper Lynd in the 2006 James Bond film \"Casino Royale.\" Another significant role was in the psychological horror film \"The Witch\" (2015), where she played the title character. She also starred in \"Artemis Fowl\" (2020), based on the popular book series. Now, I need to check if any of these projects or others she's been in have involved the character Dorian Gray. \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has been adapted into various films and TV series over the years. For instance, there was a 1999 film adaptation starring James Marsters as Dorian Gray, and a 2009 version with Ben Barnes in the lead role. There's also a TV series titled \"Penny Dreadful,\" which includes a character named Dorian Gray, portrayed by Reeve Carney in the first season and later by Rory Kinnear. Looking at Eva Green's involvement, she starred in \"Penny Dreadful\" as Dr. Seward. In that series, Dorian Gray is a significant character, but Eva Green's role was separate. She didn't portray Dorian Gray herself. Therefore, while she was in the same project where Dorian Gray appeared, she didn't play the character. Additionally, I'll consider other projects. There's a musical adaptation of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" but I don't recall Eva Green being part of that. Other adaptations, such as the 1986 TV movie, don't feature her either. So, putting it all together: Oscar Wilde's most famous character is Dorian Gray.",
