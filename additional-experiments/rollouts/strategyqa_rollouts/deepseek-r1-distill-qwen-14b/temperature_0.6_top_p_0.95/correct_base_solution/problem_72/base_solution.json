  "solution": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a hypothetical Yeti would be towered over by Andre the Giant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the sizes of both the Yeti and Andre the Giant. Andre the Giant was a real person, a French professional wrestler known for his height. I remember hearing that he was extremely tall. From what I recall, he was over 7 feet tall, maybe even closer to 7.5 feet. That's really tall for a human.\n\nNow, what about a Yeti? The Yeti is a mythical creature, often described as similar to Bigfoot or the Abominable Snowman. In folklore, Yetis are typically depicted as large, hairy, and living in mountainous regions. But how tall exactly? I think in most stories, Yetis are said to be around 7 to 9 feet tall. Some accounts might even make them taller, but I don't think they're usually described as being much taller than Andre the Giant.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact height of Yetis. I should double-check that. From what I remember, the Yeti is generally considered to be about 7 to 9 feet tall, which is taller than the average human but not necessarily taller than Andre the Giant. Since Andre was around 7.5 feet, a Yeti at 7 feet would be slightly shorter, but if the Yeti is 8 or 9 feet, then it would be taller.\n\nBut the question is whether the Yeti would be towered over by Andre. So, if the Yeti is shorter than Andre, then Andre would tower over the Yeti. However, if the Yeti is taller, then the opposite would be true.\n\nI think the Yeti is usually depicted as being taller than an average human but not necessarily taller than someone like Andre the Giant. So, in that case, Andre would be taller than the Yeti, meaning the Yeti would be towered over by Andre.\n\nWait, but I'm not 100% certain about the Yeti's height. Some sources might say they're up to 10 feet tall, which would make them taller than Andre. But I think the common depiction is around 7 to 9 feet. So, depending on the specific Yeti's height, the answer could vary.\n\nBut since the question is hypothetical, maybe we can assume a Yeti that's on the taller side. However, given that Andre was already over 7 feet, if the Yeti is around that height, it's possible they are similar in size. But would Andre tower over the Yeti? If the Yeti is, say, 7 feet, and Andre is 7.5 feet, then yes, Andre would be taller.\n\nAlternatively, if the Yeti is 8 feet, then Andre wouldn't tower over it; they'd be similar in height, or the Yeti would be taller.\n\nBut since the question is about a hypothetical Yeti, perhaps we can assume a Yeti that's within the typical range, say around 7 to 8 feet. Andre being over 7.5 feet would mean he's taller than a 7-foot Yeti but maybe not taller than an 8-foot one.\n\nSo, considering the average Yeti height and Andre's height, it's likely that Andre would be taller, thus tower over the Yeti.\n</think>\n\nAndre the Giant was approximately 7.5 feet tall, while a hypothetical Yeti is typically depicted as being around 7 to 9 feet tall. Given these heights, Andre would likely tower over a Yeti that is shorter than him, but not one that is taller. Since the Yeti is often described as being within the 7 to 8-foot range, Andre would indeed be taller. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",
