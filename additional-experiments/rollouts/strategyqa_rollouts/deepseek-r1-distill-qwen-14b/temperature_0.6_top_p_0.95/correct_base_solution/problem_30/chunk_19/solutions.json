Question: Would Adam Sandler get a reference to Cole Spouse and a scuba man doll?\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether Adam Sandler would get a reference to Cole Spouse and a scuba man doll. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step. First, I should understand what each part means. Cole Spouse... wait, that sounds familiar. Isn't that a character from one of Adam Sandler's movies? I think it's from \"The Wedding Singer.\" Yeah, Cole Spouse is a character played by Sandler in that movie. So, that's a reference to his own work. Now, the scuba man doll.

I'm not sure if he's ever put Cole Spouse and the scuba man doll together in the same project. They come from different movies, so it's possible he might not have done that yet. But considering his style, it's plausible he might do it in a future project as a nod to his fans. So, the answer would depend on whether he's done it already or if it's a possibility in the future. Since I'm not sure if he's actually done it, I might lean towards no, but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should check if there's any instance where he combined these references. After a quick search, I don't find any evidence of both references being used together. So, probably not yet. But he might in the future. However, the question is whether he would get the reference, meaning if he includes both, which he hasn't done yet.

I'm not sure if he's ever put Cole Spouse and the scuba man doll together in the same project. They come from different movies, so it's possible he might not have done that yet. But he does like to reference his own work, so maybe in the future, he could. However, based on his past behavior, it's likely he would include such references if he wanted to. So, putting it all together, the answer is probably yes because he's done similar things before, even if not exactly those two together.\n</think>\n\nAdam Sandler is known for incorporating self-referential humor, often referencing his past roles and movies.
