Question: Would Adam Sandler get a reference to Cole Spouse and a scuba man doll?\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether Adam Sandler would get a reference to Cole Spouse and a scuba man doll. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step. First, I should understand what each part means. Cole Spouse... wait, that sounds familiar. Isn't that a character from one of Adam Sandler's movies? I think it's from \"The Wedding Singer.\" Yeah, Cole Spouse is a character played by Sandler in that movie. So, that's a reference to his own work. Now, the scuba man doll. I'm trying to remember if that's from another Sandler movie. Oh, right! It's from \"Big Daddy.\" In that movie, there's a scene where the character played by Sandler, who's a sperm donor, uses a scuba man doll as a reference point. So, that's another self-referential joke. So, the question is asking if Adam Sandler would include both these references in his work. From what I know, Sandler often uses self-referential humor in his movies. For example, in \"The Adam Sandler Show,\" he makes jokes about his past roles. So, it's possible that in a future movie or comedy special, he might include both the Cole Spouse and the scuba man doll as references. But I'm not sure if he's specifically done that yet. I don't recall a specific instance where both are in the same project, but since he's known for this kind of humor, it's plausible that he would do it at some point. So, putting it all together, I think the answer would be yes because he frequently uses self-references in his work, even if he hasn't combined these two specific references yet.\n</think>\n\nAdam Sandler is known for incorporating self-referential humor in his work, often referencing his past roles.

I think it's from \"The Wedding Singer.\" Yeah, Cole Spouse is a character played by Sandler in that movie. So, that's a reference to his own work. Now, the scuba man doll. I'm trying to remember if that's from another Sandler movie. Oh, right! It's from \"Big Daddy.\" In that movie, there's a scene where the character played by Sandler, who's a sperm donor, uses a scuba man doll as a reference point. So, that's another self-referential joke. So, the question is asking if Adam Sandler would include both these references in his work. From what I know, he often uses self-referential humor, so it's possible. But would he specifically include both in the same work? I'm not sure if he's done that yet, but he has done similar things before. So, maybe the answer is yes.\n</think>\n\nAdam Sandler often incorporates self-referential humor in his movies, including references to his own characters. \"Cole Spouse\" is a character from \"The Wedding Singer,\" and the scuba man doll appears in \"Big Daddy.\" While Sandler has used self-references, there's no known instance where both specific references appear in the same work. Therefore, it's unlikely he would include both in the same context.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",
