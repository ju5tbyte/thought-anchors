I don't recall a specific instance where both Cole Spouse and the scuba man doll are mentioned together. However, it's possible that in a new project, he might make a joke that includes both. Since he often does self-references, it's plausible, but I don't have a specific example. So, based on his style, it's likely he would, but without a concrete instance, it's uncertain.

But the way the question is phrased, it's asking if he would get both references in a single context. Since I don't have evidence of both being used together, I'm leaning towards no. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes these references can be subtle and I might not have noticed them together.\n</think>\n\nAdam Sandler is known for incorporating self-referential humor in his work, often referencing his past characters and movies.

Question: Would Adam Sandler get a reference to Cole Spouse and a scuba man doll?\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether Adam Sandler would get a reference to Cole Spouse and a scuba man doll. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step. First, I should understand what each part means. Cole Spouse... wait, that sounds familiar. Isn't that a character from one of Adam Sandler's movies? I think it's from \"The Wedding Singer.\" Yeah, Cole Spouse is a character played by Sandler in that movie. So, that's a reference to his own work. Now, the scuba man doll. I'm trying to remember if that's from another Sandler movie. Oh, right! It's from \"Big Daddy.\" In that movie, there's a scene where the character played by Sandler, who's a sperm donor, uses a scuba man doll as a reference point. So, that's another self-referential joke. So, the question is asking if Adam Sandler would include both these references in his work. Well, he's known for using self-referential humor, often bringing up his past characters or movies in his new works. For example, in \"The Adam Sandler Show,\" he sometimes references his other roles. But wait, does he combine these two specific references in any of his movies or shows? I'm not sure if he's ever done both in the same project. However, the fact that he's done both individually suggests that he might include both if the context allows. So, considering his style, it's plausible that he would make a reference to both Cole Spouse and the scuba man doll in a joke or scene, especially in a movie or show where he can tie together different elements of his career. Therefore, the answer would be yes.\n</think>\n\nAdam Sandler often uses self-referential humor, referencing his own characters and movies. Cole Spouse from \"The Wedding Singer\" and the scuba man doll from \"Big Daddy\" are both his characters. While he hasn't combined both in the same work, his style suggests he might, given the right context. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

So, that's another self-referential joke. So, the question is asking if Adam Sandler would include both these references in his work. Well, he's known for using self-referential humor, often bringing up his past characters or movies in his new works. For example, in \"The Adam Sandler Show,\" he sometimes references his other roles. But wait, does he combine these two specific references in any of his movies or shows? I'm trying to recall. I think in \"The Adam Sandler Show,\" there's an episode where he mentions \"Big Daddy\" and perhaps the scuba man doll. And in \"The Wedding Singer,\" the character Cole Spouse is a main part of the plot. So, if Sandler were to create a new project, it's possible he might include both references, especially if it's a show or movie that allows for callbacks to his past roles. However, I'm not sure if he's specifically done both in the same project. Maybe in a recent movie or a newer show? I'm not entirely certain, but based on his style, it seems plausible. So, considering his tendency to include self-references, the answer would likely be yes.\n</think>\n\nAdam Sandler is known for incorporating self-referential humor, often referencing his past roles and movies.
