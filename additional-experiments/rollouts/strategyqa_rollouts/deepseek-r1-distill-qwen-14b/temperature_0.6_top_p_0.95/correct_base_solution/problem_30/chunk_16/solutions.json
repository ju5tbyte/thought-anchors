Question: Would Adam Sandler get a reference to Cole Spouse and a scuba man doll?\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether Adam Sandler would get a reference to Cole Spouse and a scuba man doll. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step. First, I should understand what each part means. Cole Spouse... wait, that sounds familiar. Isn't that a character from one of Adam Sandler's movies? I think it's from \"The Wedding Singer.\" Yeah, Cole Spouse is a character played by Sandler in that movie. So, that's a reference to his own work. Now, the scuba man doll.

So, that's another self-referential joke. So, the question is asking if Adam Sandler would include both these references in his work. Well, he's known for using self-referential humor, often bringing up his past characters or movies in his new works. For example, in \"The Adam Sandler Show,\" he sometimes references his other roles. So, it's possible that he would include both references. But wait, the question is whether he would get a reference to both in a single work. I'm not sure if he's done that specifically, but considering his style, it's plausible. He's done similar things before, like referencing \"Billy Madison\" in other movies. So, putting it all together, it seems like he might include both references, especially in a context where he's doing a comedy or a show that allows for that kind of humor.

Question: Would Adam Sandler get a reference to Cole Spouse and a scuba man doll?\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether Adam Sandler would get a reference to Cole Spouse and a scuba man doll. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step. First, I should understand what each part means. Cole Spouse... wait, that sounds familiar. Isn't that a character from one of Adam Sandler's movies? I think it's from \"The Wedding Singer.\" Yeah, Cole Spouse is a character played by Sandler in that movie. So, that's a reference to his own work. Now, the scuba man doll. I'm trying to remember if that's from another Sandler movie. Oh, right! It's from \"Big Daddy.\" In that movie, there's a scene where the character played by Sandler, who's a sperm donor, uses a scuba man doll as a reference point. So, that's another self-referential joke. So, the question is asking if Adam Sandler would include both these references in his work. Well, he's known for using self-referential humor, often bringing up his past characters or movies in his new works. For example, in \"The Adam Sandler Show,\" he sometimes references his other roles. So, it's possible he might include both references. But wait, does he combine them in a single project? I'm not sure if he's done that, but considering his style, he might. Alternatively, maybe the question is about a specific instance where both are referenced together. I don't recall a specific instance where both Cole Spouse and the scuba man doll appear in the same movie or show. But since he often uses callbacks to his past, it's plausible that he might do so in the future. So, considering his past behavior, the answer would be yes, he would get such references.\n</think>\n\nAdam Sandler is known for incorporating self-referential humor, often acknowledging his past characters and movies.

I think it's from \"The Wedding Singer.\" Yeah, Cole Spouse is a character played by Sandler in that movie. So, that's a reference to his own work. Now, the scuba man doll.
