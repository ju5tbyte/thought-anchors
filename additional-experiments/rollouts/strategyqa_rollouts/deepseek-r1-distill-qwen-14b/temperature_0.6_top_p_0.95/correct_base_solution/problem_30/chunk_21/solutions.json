But if he were to make a movie or a show that's a tribute to his career, maybe he would include both as a nod to his past roles. However, the question is whether he \"would\" get such a reference. Since he's known for doing this kind of thing, it's plausible. But without a specific instance, it's hard to say definitively. So, considering his style and past behavior, it's likely he would include such references, but not certain. Maybe I should check if there's any existing content where he combines both. If not, then the answer might be no, but it's a possibility. Alternatively, he might do it in a future project. Since the question is about whether he would, it's more about his tendencies rather than specific past actions. So, I think the answer is yes because he often includes self-references, but I'm not 100% certain without a specific example.\n</think>\n\nAdam Sandler is known for incorporating self-referential humor in his work, often nodding to his past roles and movies.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step. First, I should understand what each part means. Cole Spouse... wait, that sounds familiar. Isn't that a character from one of Adam Sandler's movies? I think it's from \"The Wedding Singer.\" Yeah, Cole Spouse is a character played by Sandler in that movie. So, that's a reference to his own work. Now, the scuba man doll.

It's from \"Big Daddy.\" In that movie, there's a scene where the character played by Sandler, who's a sperm donor, uses a scuba man doll as a reference point. So, that's another self-referential joke. So, the question is asking if Adam Sandler would include both these references in his work. Well, he's known for using self-referential humor, often bringing up his past characters or movies in his new works. For example, in \"The Adam Sandler Show,\" he sometimes references his other roles. But wait, does he combine these two specific references in any of his movies or shows? I'm not sure if he's ever put Cole Spouse and the scuba man doll together in the same project. They come from different movies, so it's possible he might not have done that yet. But if he were to make a movie or a show that's a tribute to his career, maybe he would include both as a nod to his past roles. However, the question is whether he \"would\" get such a reference. Since he's done self-references before, it's plausible he might do it again, but I don't know if he's specifically done both together.
