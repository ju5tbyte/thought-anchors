  "prompt": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Would Adam Sandler get a reference to Cole Spouse and a scuba man doll?\n<think>\n",
  "solution": "Alright, so I need to figure out whether Adam Sandler would get a reference to Cole Spouse and a scuba man doll. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part means. Cole Spouse... wait, that sounds familiar. Isn't that a character from one of Adam Sandler's movies? I think it's from \"The Wedding Singer.\" Yeah, Cole Spouse is a character played by Sandler in that movie. So, that's a reference to his own work.\n\nNow, the scuba man doll. I'm trying to remember if that's from another Sandler movie. Oh, right! It's from \"Big Daddy.\" In that movie, there's a scene where the character played by Sandler, who's a sperm donor, uses a scuba man doll as a reference point. So, that's another self-referential joke.\n\nSo, the question is asking if Adam Sandler would include both these references in his work. Well, he's known for using self-referential humor, often bringing up his past characters or movies in his new works. For example, in \"The Adam Sandler Show,\" he sometimes references his other roles.\n\nBut wait, does he combine these two specific references in any of his movies or shows? I'm not sure if he's ever put Cole Spouse and the scuba man doll together in the same project. They come from different movies, so it's possible he might not have done that yet. But if he were to make a movie or a show that's a tribute to his career, maybe he would include both as a nod to his past roles.\n\nHowever, the question is whether he \"would\" get such a reference. Since he's done self-references before, it's plausible that he would include these if the opportunity arises. But I'm not certain if he's done it specifically with both together.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while he's done self-references, combining both Cole Spouse and the scuba man doll might be a stretch. But since he's known for that kind of humor, the answer leans towards yes.\n</think>\n\nAdam Sandler is known for incorporating self-referential humor in his work, often nodding to his past characters and movies. Cole Spouse, from \"The Wedding Singer,\" and the scuba man doll, from \"Big Daddy,\" are both examples of such references. While Sandler has included individual references, combining both in a single work isn't confirmed. However, given his style, it's plausible he would include both if the context allowed. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",
