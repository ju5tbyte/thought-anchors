This could be a downside because lawyers are bound by ethics and should argue based on the law and facts, not just to win. So, while they had the skills, their approach might have clashed with the ethical standards expected of lawyers. Additionally, the Sophists were more about teaching general skills rather than the specific legal knowledge needed. In ancient times, the law was more about oratory since written laws weren't as codified as they are today. So, their skills in public speaking and argumentation would have been directly applicable. But in modern times, lawyers also need a deep understanding of legal codes, precedents, and procedures, which the Sophists might not have provided. However, the question is hypothetical, so maybe in the context where they were teaching, their skills would have sufficed for the role of a lawyer. So, considering their strengths in rhetoric and persuasion, but also their ethical relativism, it's a bit mixed. They had the necessary skills but might have lacked in the ethical application required for law. But since the question is hypothetical, perhaps focusing on their skills alone, they could have made good lawyers.\n</think>\n\nThe Sophists, known for their expertise in rhetoric and persuasion, possessed skills that are relevant to lawyering, such as argumentation and public speaking. However, their ethical relativism and focus on winning arguments regardless of truth may conflict with the ethical standards expected of lawyers.

They were known for teaching how to make persuasive arguments regardless of the underlying truth. So, does that mean they would make good lawyers? Well, in a way, yes, because lawyers do need to persuade, but it's a bit of a double-edged sword. If a Sophist's approach is purely about winning, they might not always care about the justice or the actual merits of the case, which could be problematic. \n\nAnother point is the historical context. The Sophists were more about general education and training in public speaking and critical thinking. They didn't practice law as we know it today, but their skills were applicable to various fields, including law. So, if we imagine them applying their skills to law, they might have been effective. However, their methods were sometimes seen as manipulative or unethical because they taught how to argue any side, regardless of its validity. \n\nI should also consider the structure of ancient Greek law. Back then, law wasn't as formalized as it is now. Disputes were often resolved through public debates or discussions facilitated by magistrates. In this setting, the Sophists' skills in rhetoric and argumentation would have been highly valuable.

Question: Would Sophist's have hypothetically made good lawyers?\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Sophists would have made good lawyers hypothetically. First, I need to understand who the Sophists were. From what I remember, they were a group of teachers in ancient Greece, particularly in the 5th century BCE. They were known for teaching rhetoric, argumentation, and public speaking. People like Protagoras and Gorgias were famous Sophists. So, the question is asking if these Sophists would have been good lawyers. Well, considering that lawyers need to be skilled in argumentation, public speaking, and understanding laws, the Sophists seem to fit some of these criteria. They focused a lot on rhetoric and persuasion, which are key skills for a lawyer, especially in court where convincing a jury or judge is essential. \n\nBut wait, the Sophists were also criticized for being too concerned with winning arguments rather than seeking the truth. They were known for teaching how to make persuasive arguments regardless of the underlying truth. So, does that mean they would make good lawyers? Well, in a way, yes, because lawyers do need to persuade, but it's a bit of a double-edged sword. If a Sophist's approach is purely about winning, they might not always care about the justice or the actual merits of the case, which could be problematic. \n\nAnother point is the historical context. The Sophists were more about general education and training in public speaking and critical thinking. They didn't practice law as we know it today, but their skills were applicable to various fields, including law. So, if we imagine them applying their skills to law, they might have been effective. However, their methods were sometimes seen as manipulative or unethical because they taught how to argue any side, regardless of its validity. \n\nI should also consider the structure of ancient Greek law. Back then, law wasn't as formalized as it is now. Disputes were often resolved through public debates or discussions facilitated by magistrates. In this setting, the Sophists' skills in rhetoric and argumentation would have been highly valuable. They could have used their skills to represent clients effectively, even if it meant bending the truth or presenting the best possible argument from their client's perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, modern law has a strong emphasis on ethics, evidence, and the rule of law.

The Sophists were often criticized for being relativists, believing that truth is relative and that knowledge is based on human perception rather than objective truth. This could be a double-edged sword. While their relativistic approach might allow them to argue any side effectively, it might also make them seem untrustworthy or inconsistent if they change their arguments based on what suits them better. Lawyers need to be credible, so if someone is seen as just arguing for the sake of winning regardless of the truth, that could harm their reputation.\n\nAnother point is the content of their teachings. Sophists taught how to win arguments through clever use of language and logic, sometimes using fallacies or emotional appeals. While this is useful in\u8fa9\u8bba, it might not always lead to just or fair outcomes. A good lawyer should not only win cases but also uphold justice and the best interests of their clients. If the Sophists were only focused on winning regardless of the moral implications, they might not make the most ethical lawyers.\n\nAlso, I should think about the structure of the legal system back then. The Sophists were active in ancient Greece, which had different legal systems compared to modern times. For example, in Athens, trials were more like public debates where the ability to speak persuasively was crucial. So, in that context, Sophists would have been well-suited as legal advocates. But the question is hypothetical, so it's about whether their skills would translate to a modern legal setting.\n\nIn modern law, while rhetoric and argumentation are important, there's also a strong emphasis on knowledge of the law, procedural understanding, and ethical conduct. Sophists might have lacked formal legal training in the modern sense. They focused more on the art of persuasion rather than the specifics of legal codes and precedents. This could be a limitation. However, their skill in public speaking and logical argumentation is still highly valuable.\n\nAdditionally, the role of a lawyer involves not just arguing cases but also advising clients, drafting documents, and understanding complex legal systems. The Sophists were more about public performance and teaching rhetoric, so they might not have had the same depth of knowledge in the practical aspects of law. But in a hypothetical scenario, if we consider only their rhetorical skills, they might still make good lawyers, especially in roles that emphasize advocacy.\n\nI should also consider the ethical standards. Modern lawyers are bound by codes of conduct and have a duty to serve the interest of justice.

    "full_cot": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Would Sophist's have hypothetically made good lawyers?\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Sophists would have made good lawyers hypothetically. First, I need to understand who the Sophists were. From what I remember, they were a group of teachers in ancient Greece, particularly in the 5th century BCE. They were known for teaching rhetoric, argumentation, and public speaking. People like Protagoras and Gorgias were famous Sophists. So, the question is asking if these Sophists would have been good lawyers. Well, considering that lawyers need to be skilled in argumentation, public speaking, and understanding laws, the Sophists seem to fit some of these criteria. They focused a lot on rhetoric and persuasion, which are key skills for a lawyer, especially in court where convincing a jury or judge is essential. \n\nBut wait, I should also consider the context of their time. The Sophists were often criticized for being relativists, believing that truth is relative and that knowledge is based on human perception rather than objective truth. This could be a double-edged sword. While their relativistic approach might allow them to argue any side effectively, it might also make them seem untrustworthy or inconsistent if they change their arguments based on what suits them better. Lawyers need to be credible, so if someone is seen as just arguing for the sake of winning regardless of the truth, that could harm their reputation.\n\nAnother point is the content of their teachings. Sophists taught how to win arguments through clever use of language and logic, sometimes using fallacies or emotional appeals. While this is useful in\u8fa9\u8bba, it might not always lead to just or fair outcomes. A good lawyer should not only win cases but also uphold justice and the best interests of their clients. If the Sophists were only focused on winning regardless of the moral implications, they might not make the most ethical lawyers.\n\nAlso, I should think about the structure of the legal system back then. The Sophists were active in ancient Greece, which had different legal systems compared to modern times. For example, in Athens, trials were more like public debates where the ability to speak persuasively was crucial. So, in that context, Sophists would have been well-suited as legal advocates. But the question is hypothetical, so it's about whether their skills would translate to a modern legal setting.\n\nIn modern law, while rhetoric and argumentation are important, there's also a strong emphasis on knowledge of the law, procedural understanding, and ethical conduct. Sophists might have lacked formal legal training in the modern sense. They focused more on the art of persuasion rather than the specifics of legal codes and precedents. This could be a limitation. However, their skill in public speaking and logical argumentation is still highly valuable.\n\nAdditionally, the role of a lawyer involves not just arguing cases but also advising clients, drafting documents, and understanding complex legal systems. The Sophists were more about public performance and teaching rhetoric, so they might not have had the same depth of knowledge in the practical aspects of law. But in a hypothetical scenario, if we consider only their rhetorical skills, they might still make good lawyers, especially in roles that emphasize advocacy.\n\nI should also consider the ethical standards. Modern lawyers are bound by codes of conduct and have a duty to serve the interest of justice. Sophists, on the other hand, were often seen as mercenaries of rhetoric, taking paying students and teaching them how to win arguments regardless of the moral implications. This could mean that they might prioritize their clients' interests over justice, which isn't in line with the ethical expectations of modern lawyers. However, in a purely hypothetical sense, ignoring ethical considerations, their skills would make them effective advocates.\n\nMoreover, the Sophists' ability to adapt and argue any side could be advantageous in a trial setting.

The Sophists were more like itinerant teachers who charged fees for their instruction. They taught young men the skills needed for public life, including rhetoric, which was crucial for leadership roles in democratic Athens.

The Sophists might have prepared their students for roles in governance or public speaking, but not necessarily for the specific responsibilities of a lawyer in a court of law. \n\nMoreover, the Sophists emphasized relativism and the idea that truth is subjective.

    "full_cot": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Would Sophist's have hypothetically made good lawyers?\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Sophists would have made good lawyers hypothetically. First, I need to understand who the Sophists were. From what I remember, they were a group of teachers in ancient Greece, particularly in the 5th century BCE. They were known for teaching rhetoric, argumentation, and public speaking. People like Protagoras and Gorgias were famous Sophists. So, the question is asking if these Sophists would have been good lawyers. Well, considering that lawyers need to be skilled in argumentation, public speaking, and understanding laws, the Sophists seem to fit some of these criteria. They focused a lot on rhetoric and persuasion, which are key skills for a lawyer, especially in court where convincing a jury or judge is essential. \n\nBut I also remember that the Sophists were often criticized for being too concerned with winning arguments rather than seeking the truth. They were known for teaching how to argue effectively, sometimes even using fallacies or emotional appeals. This could be a double-edged sword. While their skills would make them persuasive, they might not always prioritize the merits of the case over winning. Additionally, the role of a lawyer involves understanding the law deeply, and I'm not sure if the Sophists were experts in legal codes or if their training was more about general argumentative skills. \n\nAnother point is the historical context. The Sophists were more like itinerant teachers who charged fees for their instruction. They taught young men the skills needed for public life, including rhetoric, which was crucial for leadership roles in democratic Athens. However, the practice of law as we know it today didn't exist back then. The Sophists might have prepared their students for roles in governance or public speaking, but not necessarily for the specific responsibilities of a lawyer in a court of law. \n\nMoreover, the Sophists emphasized relativism and the idea that truth is subjective. This could clash with the objective nature of law, where certain truths about legal principles and precedents are foundational. A lawyer needs to apply the law accurately, which requires a solid understanding of legal principles, not just the ability to argue persuasively. So while the Sophists were skilled in argumentation, their approach might not have provided the necessary depth in legal knowledge required for effective lawyering. \n\nOn the other hand, if we imagine a hypothetical scenario where Sophists applied their skills to law, they might have excelled in certain areas. For example, in courtrooms where the ability to persuade is paramount, their training would have been beneficial. They could have used their rhetorical techniques to present cases more effectively, perhaps even influencing the development of legal strategies. \n\nHowever, without formal legal education, they might have struggled with the specifics of legal codes, statutes, and precedents. This could lead to misunderstandings or errors in applying the law, which is crucial for a lawyer's effectiveness. Additionally, the ethical considerations of lawyering might not have aligned with the Sophists' methods. Lawyers are expected to act in the best interest of their clients while upholding the law, but the Sophists were sometimes seen as mercenaries of rhetoric, willing to argue any side for pay, regardless of its moral standing. This could lead to ethical dilemmas if they applied their methods to law. \n\nIn summary, while Sophists had skills that are relevant to lawyering, such as rhetoric and persuasion, their approach might have lacked the depth of legal knowledge and the ethical considerations necessary for the role.

They focused a lot on rhetoric and persuasion, which are key skills for a lawyer, especially in court where convincing a jury or judge is essential. \n\nBut wait, were the Sophists actually involved in legal practice, or were they more theoretical? I think they were more like teachers offering courses on how to argue effectively rather than practicing lawyers. Their approach was more about teaching the art of persuasion rather than the specifics of the law. So, while they taught skills that are useful for lawyers, they might not have had the in-depth knowledge of the law itself. \n\nAnother point is the ethical aspect. Sophists were sometimes criticized for being too concerned with winning an argument rather than seeking the truth. They used rhetoric to persuade, regardless of the merits of the case. If that's the case, would that make them good lawyers? Ethical considerations are crucial in law, so if Sophists were only focused on winning regardless of the facts, that might not be ideal. \n\nOn the other hand, their ability to argue from both sides, a technique known as \"antilogic,\" could be beneficial in legal settings where understanding both perspectives is necessary. They taught how to construct arguments from any viewpoint, which is a valuable skill in court. \n\nSo, putting it all together, while Sophists had many skills that overlap with those of lawyers, such as rhetoric and argumentation, their lack of formal legal training and their focus on persuasion over truth might have been drawbacks. However, their teaching methods and skills in debate could have been advantageous in certain legal contexts. Therefore, it's possible that they would have made good lawyers, especially in roles where persuasive skills are more emphasized than deep legal knowledge.\n</think>\n\nSophists were ancient Greek teachers known for their expertise in rhetoric and argumentation, skills that are valuable for lawyers.

They focused a lot on rhetoric and persuasion, which are key skills for a lawyer, especially in court where convincing a jury or judge is essential. \n\nBut wait, I should think about the context. The Sophists were more about teaching how to argue effectively, sometimes even for or against a position regardless of its truth. They were criticized for being relativists, believing that truth is subjective. If that's the case, would that approach serve a lawyer well? A good lawyer should argue based on the law and the facts, not just persuade for the sake of winning. So, maybe their relativistic views could be a downside because they might prioritize winning over justice. \n\nAlso, the Sophists were known for charging fees, which made them accessible to the wealthy, but I'm not sure how that ties into their effectiveness as lawyers. Maybe it's more about their methods. They taught how to structure arguments and use logic, which is useful, but if they didn't care about the ethics of the case, that could be problematic. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the Sophists had the necessary skills in rhetoric and persuasion, which are important for lawyering. However, their emphasis on relativism and the pursuit of victory over truth might conflict with the ethical standards expected of lawyers. Therefore, while they might have been effective in certain aspects, their overall approach might not align perfectly with the role of a lawyer, especially one who adheres to ethical principles.\n</think>\n\nThe Sophists, known for their expertise in rhetoric and persuasion, possessed skills relevant to lawyering, such as argumentation and public speaking.

    "full_cot": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Would Sophist's have hypothetically made good lawyers?\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Sophists would have made good lawyers hypothetically. First, I need to understand who the Sophists were. From what I remember, they were a group of teachers in ancient Greece, particularly in the 5th century BCE. They were known for teaching rhetoric, argumentation, and public speaking. People like Protagoras and Gorgias were famous Sophists. So, the question is asking if these Sophists would have been good lawyers. Well, considering that lawyers need to be skilled in argumentation, public speaking, and understanding laws, the Sophists seem to fit some of these criteria. They focused a lot on rhetoric and persuasion, which are key skills for a lawyer, especially in court where convincing a jury or judge is essential. \n\nBut I should also think about the context of their time. The Sophists were often criticized for being too concerned with winning arguments rather than seeking the truth. They taught how to argue effectively, sometimes even using fallacies or emotional appeals. If this approach was applied to law, it might not always lead to just or fair outcomes. Lawyers, especially in modern times, are expected to uphold the law and represent their clients ethically. So, while Sophists were skilled in argument, their methods might have been more about winning than about the justice or merits of the case. \n\nAdditionally, the role of a lawyer today involves a deep understanding of legal codes, precedents, and the judicial system, which the Sophists might not have had. They focused more on general rhetoric and less on the specifics of law. So, even though they were good at arguing, they might not have had the specialized knowledge required to be effective lawyers in the modern sense. \n\nOn the other hand, if we consider a hypothetical scenario where the Sophists applied their skills within the legal framework of their time, they might have been quite effective. They were known for their ability to defend clients, especially in legal disputes, by using their rhetorical skills. For example, Gorgias was known for his skill in defending the accused, which is a core part of what a lawyer does. So, in that context, they could have made good lawyers because they were trained in the art of persuasion and argumentation, which are directly applicable to legal practice. \n\nBut then again, the Sophists were also criticized for charging money for their teachings, which some saw as mercenary.

The Sophists were often criticized for being relativists, believing that truth is relative and that knowledge is based on human perception rather than objective truth. This could be a double-edged sword. While their ability to argue from multiple perspectives might make them skilled debaters, it might also lead them to be seen as manipulative or unethical if they twisted facts to fit their arguments. Lawyers have an ethical responsibility to represent their clients fairly without misleading the court, so if the Sophists were too relativistic, that could be a problem.\n\nAnother point is the structure of the legal system in ancient Greece compared to today. The Sophists were more involved in public speaking and education rather than the legal system as we know it. They taught how to win arguments, but the actual practice of law, especially in courts, was different. So, even if they were good at arguing, their direct experience with the legal system might have been limited. They might have had the skills, but perhaps not the specific knowledge of the laws and procedures of their time.\n\nI also recall that some Sophists, like Gorgias, were known for their expertise in specific areas, such as rhetoric and persuasion, but not necessarily in the law. They were more about teaching how to persuade rather than about the legal content itself. So, while they could make a compelling argument, they might not have the in-depth knowledge of the legal codes and precedents that a lawyer needs.\n\nMoreover, the role of a lawyer involves not just arguing but also understanding the law, preparing cases, and knowing the implications of legal decisions. The Sophists focused more on the art of persuasion rather than the specifics of legal practice.

Their ability to construct strong arguments and persuade others might make them formidable lawyers. However, their ethical approach would be crucial. If they adhered to the principles of honesty and fairness, they could be good lawyers.

    "full_cot": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Would Sophist's have hypothetically made good lawyers?\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Sophists would have made good lawyers hypothetically. First, I need to understand who the Sophists were. From what I remember, they were a group of teachers in ancient Greece, particularly in the 5th century BCE. They were known for teaching rhetoric, argumentation, and public speaking. People like Protagoras and Gorgias were famous Sophists. So, the question is asking if these Sophists would have been good lawyers. Well, considering that lawyers need to be skilled in argumentation, public speaking, and understanding laws, the Sophists seem to fit some of these criteria. They focused a lot on rhetoric and persuasion, which are key skills for a lawyer, especially in court where convincing a jury or judge is essential. \n\nBut wait, I should think about the context of their time. The Sophists were often criticized for being relativists, believing that truth is relative and that knowledge is based on human perception rather than objective truth. This could be a double-edged sword. While their ability to argue from multiple perspectives might make them skilled debaters, it might also lead them to be seen as manipulative or unethical if they twisted facts to fit their arguments. Lawyers have an ethical responsibility to represent their clients fairly without misleading the court, so if the Sophists were too relativistic, that could be a problem.\n\nAnother point is the structure of the legal system in ancient Greece compared to today. The Sophists were more involved in public speaking and education rather than the legal system as we know it. They taught how to win arguments, but the actual practice of law, especially in courts, was different. So, even if they were good at arguing, their direct experience with the legal system might have been limited. They might have had the skills, but perhaps not the specific knowledge of the laws and procedures of their time.\n\nI also recall that some Sophists, like Gorgias, were known for their expertise in specific areas, such as rhetoric and persuasion, but not necessarily in the law. They were more about teaching how to persuade rather than about the legal content itself. So, while they could make a compelling argument, they might not have the in-depth knowledge of the legal codes and precedents that a lawyer needs.\n\nMoreover, the role of a lawyer involves not just arguing but also understanding the law, preparing cases, and knowing the implications of legal decisions. The Sophists focused more on the art of persuasion rather than the specifics of legal practice. So, even though they were skilled in argumentation, they might lack the practical legal knowledge required to be effective lawyers.\n\nOn the other hand, if we imagine a hypothetical scenario where the Sophists applied their rhetorical skills within a legal framework, they could potentially be very effective. Their ability to construct strong arguments and persuade others might make them formidable lawyers. However, their ethical approach would be crucial. If they adhered to the principles of honesty and fairness, they could be good lawyers. But if they used their relativistic views to manipulate the truth, it could lead to unethical practices.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the Sophists had the necessary skills in rhetoric and persuasion that are valuable for lawyers.

This adaptability would be beneficial in a legal setting where a lawyer might have to defend a client regardless of personal beliefs. Their skill in argumentation would allow them to present a strong case, even if they didn't agree with the client's position.\n\nOn the other hand, the Sophists were often seen as relativists, believing that truth is subjective and dependent on perspective. This could lead to a more pragmatic approach to law, focusing on what works rather than what is morally correct. While this might not always serve justice, it could make them effective advocates in a system that relies on procedure and argumentation.\n\nIn conclusion, considering their expertise in rhetoric, persuasion, and argumentation, it seems plausible that Sophists would have made good lawyers. Their skills were directly applicable to the tasks required in legal disputes of their time, and their training in public speaking would have been an asset. However, their approach might have been more about winning than about the ethical implications of the cases they handled.

If we look at their methods, they taught how to structure arguments, use logic, and perhaps even emotional appeals. These are all techniques that lawyers use to build a case.\n\nAnother angle is to think about the historical context. In ancient Greece, the Sophists were involved in public debates and legal disputes, which were more similar to modern legal proceedings than one might think. They operated in a society where legal disputes were often presented in a rhetorical form, so their skills were directly applicable to legal contexts. They also taught critical thinking and how to deconstruct arguments, which is valuable for both prosecuting and defending cases.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the Sophists didn't have formal legal training as we understand it today. They focused more on general education and rhetoric rather than the specific laws of a state. But in their time, legal knowledge was more integrated with general knowledge, and the line between rhetoric and law wasn't as clear. So, in their own context, their skills would have been directly applicable to legal practice.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems plausible that Sophists would have made good lawyers. Their training in rhetoric, argumentation, and public speaking would have provided them with the tools necessary for legal practice. Even though they were sometimes criticized for their methods, their ability to persuade and argue effectively would have been beneficial in a legal setting.\n</think>\n\nThe Sophists, known for their expertise in rhetoric and argumentation, would have possessed the skills necessary to be effective lawyers. Their training in persuasion and public speaking aligns with key legal competencies, such as structuring arguments and influencing juries. While they were criticized for prioritizing winning over truth, their historical role in legal disputes suggests they could apply their methods effectively. Thus, considering their skills and context, Sophists would likely have made good lawyers.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",

Question: Would Sophist's have hypothetically made good lawyers?\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Sophists would have made good lawyers hypothetically. First, I need to understand who the Sophists were. From what I remember, they were a group of teachers in ancient Greece, particularly in the 5th century BCE. They were known for teaching rhetoric, argumentation, and public speaking. People like Protagoras and Gorgias were famous Sophists. So, the question is asking if these Sophists would have been good lawyers. Well, considering that lawyers need to be skilled in argumentation, public speaking, and understanding laws, the Sophists seem to fit some of these criteria. They focused a lot on rhetoric and persuasion, which are key skills for a lawyer, especially in court where convincing a jury or judge is essential. Also, Sophists were known for their ability to make the weaker argument appear stronger, which might be useful in certain legal situations. However, I should also think about the ethical side. Some critics argue that Sophists were more interested in winning arguments than in truth or justice. If that's the case, maybe they wouldn't make the best lawyers because lawyers are also bound by ethics and professional conduct. They have a duty to represent their clients fairly and within the law, not just to win at all costs. But wait, the question is hypothetical, so maybe it's more about their skills rather than their ethics. If we set aside ethics for a moment, their skills in rhetoric and debate would definitely help in a legal context. They taught how to structure arguments, use logic, and even emotional appeal, which are all part of a lawyer's toolkit. On the other hand, the law is also about knowledge of specific legal codes, precedents, and current legislation. The Sophists might have been more generalists in their teaching, focusing on skills rather than specific content. So, would they have the in-depth knowledge needed for law?
