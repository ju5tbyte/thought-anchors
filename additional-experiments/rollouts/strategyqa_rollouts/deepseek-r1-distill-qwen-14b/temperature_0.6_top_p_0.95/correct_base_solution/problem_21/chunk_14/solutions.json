Hmm, I don't know much about her, but I'll try to break this down. First, I should probably find out Leila George's height. Models usually have specific height requirements, especially for runway or certain modeling roles. Actresses might not always need to be the same height, but sometimes height can be a factor depending on the role. I think I remember hearing that Leila George is a model as well as an actress. Maybe she's tall enough? Let me see... I believe she's around 5'8\" or 5'9\". Wait, models often need to be at least 5'8\" for women, right? So if she's around that height, she might meet the minimum requirements. But I'm not entirely sure about her exact height. Maybe I should check some sources. Oh, I think she's 5'8\". That should be sufficient for modeling. So, considering all that, I don't think she lacks the height.\n</think>\n\nLeila George's height is approximately 5'8\", which is within the typical height range for models. Therefore, she does not lack the height to be a model.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",
