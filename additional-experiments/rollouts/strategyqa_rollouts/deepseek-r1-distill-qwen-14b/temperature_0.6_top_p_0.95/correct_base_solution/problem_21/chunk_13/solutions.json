Question: Does actress Leila George lack the height to be a model?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether actress Leila George lacks the height to be a model. Hmm, I don't know much about her, but I'll try to break this down. First, I should probably find out Leila George's height. Models usually have specific height requirements, especially for runway or certain modeling roles. Actresses might not always need to be the same height, but sometimes height can be a factor depending on the role. I think I remember hearing that Leila George is a model as well as an actress. Maybe she's tall enough? Let me see... I believe she's around 5'8\" or 5'9\". Wait, models often need to be at least 5'8\" for women, right? So if she's around that height, she might meet the minimum requirements. But I'm not entirely sure about her exact height. Maybe I should check some sources. Oh, I think she's 5'7\". That's a bit below the typical model height. But then again, there are models who are shorter and still successful, especially in certain areas like fashion or commercial work. Also, acting doesn't necessarily require the same height as modeling. So, even if she's a bit shorter, she might still be able to model, especially if her other attributes make up for it. I'm leaning towards saying no, she doesn't lack the height because she's close enough and other factors matter too.\n</think>\n\nLeila George's height is approximately 5'7\", which is slightly below the typical minimum height requirement for models, which is often around 5'8\". However, there are models who successfully work at a shorter height, especially in specific areas like fashion or commercial modeling. Additionally, her career as an actress may not require the same height as modeling roles. Considering her success in both fields, it's evident that her height hasn't been a significant barrier. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>no</answer>",
