Models usually have specific height requirements, especially for runway or certain modeling roles. Actresses might not always need to be the same height, but sometimes height can be a factor depending on the role. I think I remember hearing that Leila George is a model as well as an actress. Maybe she's tall enough? Let me see... I think she's around 5'8\" or 5'9\". Now, for models, the typical height range is usually 5'8\" to 5'11\" for women, depending on the type of modeling. So if she's around that height, she might meet the requirements. Also, in the entertainment industry, looks and talent often play a bigger role than just height. So even if she's a bit shorter, she might still be successful as a model and actress. Therefore, I don't think she lacks the height.\n</think>\n\nLeila George, who is approximately 5'8\", meets the typical height requirements for models, which range from 5'8\" to 5'11\". Her height is sufficient for modeling, and her success in both modeling and acting likely depends more on her talent and overall appeal than just her height.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

Maybe she's tall enough? Let me see... I think she's around 5'9\" or 5'10\". I'm not sure about the exact number, but I think that's average for models. Models often range from 5'8\" to 6'0\" or more, depending on the type of modeling. So if she's around 5'9\", that should be sufficient. Also, as an actress, her height might not be as critical unless she's playing a specific role where height matters. Since she's both an actress and a model, it's likely that she meets the height requirements for modeling. Therefore, I don't think she lacks the height.\n</think>\n\nLeila George is an actress and model, and her height is around 5'9\", which is within the typical range for models. Therefore, she does not lack the height to be a model.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",
