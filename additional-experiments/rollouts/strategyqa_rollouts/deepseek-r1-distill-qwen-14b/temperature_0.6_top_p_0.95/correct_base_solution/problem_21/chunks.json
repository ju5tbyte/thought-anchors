  "source_text": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Does actress Leila George lack the height to be a model?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether actress Leila George lacks the height to be a model. Hmm, I don't know much about her, but I'll try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out Leila George's height. Models usually have specific height requirements, especially for runway or certain modeling roles. Actresses might not always need to be the same height, but sometimes height can be a factor depending on the role.\n\nI think I remember hearing that Leila George is a model as well as an actress. Maybe she's tall enough? Let me see... I believe she's around 5'8\" or 5'9\". Wait, models often need to be at least 5'8\" for women, right? So if she's around that height, she might meet the minimum requirements.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about her exact height. Maybe I should check some sources. Oh, I think she's 5'8\". That's the standard height for many female models, so she should be okay. Some agencies might prefer taller models, but 5'8\" is usually acceptable.\n\nAlso, being an actress, her height might not be as critical as it is for modeling. In acting, what matters more is her talent, performance, and how she fits into the character, rather than just her height. So even if she's slightly shorter than the average model, her acting skills could compensate for that.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically about whether she lacks the height to be a model. Since she's around 5'8\", which is the typical minimum, she probably doesn't lack the height. Maybe she's even taller, but I think 5'8\" is sufficient.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I don't think Leila George lacks the height to be a model. She meets the standard height requirement, and her other qualities as an actress might help her in both fields.\n</think>\n\nLeila George is approximately 5'8\", which meets the standard height requirement for many female models. Her height is sufficient for modeling, and her acting career does not necessarily hinge on her height but rather on her talent and performance. Therefore, she does not lack the height to be a model.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",
