Wait, I think she's about 5'7\" or 5'8\". If the standard model height is around 5'8\", then she might be on the lower end but still within the range. Some models are shorter, especially if they're in fashion or have a certain style that works for shorter heights. Also, acting doesn't necessarily require a specific height, so even if she's a bit shorter, she could still be a model. I don't recall any information suggesting she's too short for modeling. So, putting it all together, it seems like she probably meets the height criteria for a model.\n</think>\n\nLeila George's height is around 5'7\" to 5'8\", which is within the typical range for models, especially considering there are models of similar or shorter stature.

Also, as an actress, her height might not be as critical unless she's playing a role that requires a specific height. So, considering both her modeling and acting career, she might have made it work despite her height. Therefore, she might not lack the height to be a model, even if she's on the shorter side.

Question: Does actress Leila George lack the height to be a model?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether actress Leila George lacks the height to be a model. Hmm, I don't know much about her, but I'll try to break this down. First, I should probably find out Leila George's height. Models usually have specific height requirements, especially for runway or certain modeling roles. Actresses might not always need to be the same height, but sometimes height can be a factor depending on the role. I think I remember hearing that Leila George is a model as well as an actress. Maybe she's tall enough? I think typical model height for women is around 5'8\" or 5'9\". If she's shorter than that, maybe she couldn't be a model, but if she's around that height or taller, she might fit the criteria. I should check her height. From what I recall, Leila George is about 5'7\" or so. Wait, that's just below the typical model height. So, if the standard is 5'8\", she might be a bit short. However, in some cases, talent and other factors can compensate for height. Also, in acting, height might not be as crucial unless the role specifically requires a certain height. But the question is about modeling. So, if the typical height requirement is 5'8\" and she's 5'7\", she might not meet that standard. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact height requirements for all modeling agencies, as some might have different standards.

Question: Does actress Leila George lack the height to be a model?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether actress Leila George lacks the height to be a model. Hmm, I don't know much about her, but I'll try to break this down. First, I should probably find out Leila George's height. Models usually have specific height requirements, especially for runway or certain modeling roles. Actresses might not always need to be the same height, but sometimes height can be a factor depending on the role. I think I remember hearing that Leila George is a model as well as an actress. Maybe she's tall enough? I'm not sure about the exact height standards for models. I think for women, it's often around 5'8\" or taller, but that can vary. If Leila is above that, then she probably meets the height requirement. I should check her height to be sure. Oh, wait, I think she's about 5'7\". If that's the case, she might be just under the typical model height. But maybe she's considered tall enough for some modeling agencies. Also, in acting, height isn't always the main factor, so even if she's shorter, she could still be a successful actress and model. I'm not certain, but I think she does have the height, or at least she's close enough that it doesn't hold her back.\n</think>\n\nLeila George, known for her work as both an actress and a model, stands at approximately 5'7\". While traditional model height requirements often lean towards 5'8\" or taller, many agencies and roles accommodate those slightly shorter, especially if other attributes are strong. Therefore, Leila George's height does not preclude her from being a model. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",
