First, I should probably find out Leila George's height. Models usually have specific height requirements, especially for runway or certain modeling roles. Actresses might not always need to be the same height, but sometimes height can be a factor depending on the role. I think I remember hearing that Leila George is a model as well as an actress. Maybe she's tall enough? Let me see... I believe she's around 5'8\" or 5'9\". Wait, models often need to be at least 5'8\" for women, right? So if she's around that height, she might meet the minimum requirements. But I'm not entirely sure about her exact height. Maybe I should check some sources. Oh, I think she's 5'8\". That's the standard height for many female models, so she should be okay. Some agencies might prefer taller models, but 5'8\" is usually acceptable.",
