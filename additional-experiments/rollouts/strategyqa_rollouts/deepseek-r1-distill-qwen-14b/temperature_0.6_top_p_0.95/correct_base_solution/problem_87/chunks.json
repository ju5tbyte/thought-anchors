  "source_text": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Could ten gallons of seawater crush a six year old?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if ten gallons of seawater could crush a six-year-old. Hmm, first, I should understand how much weight ten gallons of seawater is. I remember that water has a certain weight, but I'm not exactly sure how much. Maybe I can calculate it. \n\nI think one gallon of water weighs about 8.34 pounds. So, ten gallons would be 10 times that. Let me do the math: 10 * 8.34 equals 83.4 pounds. But wait, seawater is a bit denser than regular water because of the salt. So, maybe it's a little heavier. I'm not sure how much more, but I'll assume it's around 8.5 pounds per gallon for seawater. So, ten gallons would be 10 * 8.5, which is 85 pounds.\n\nNow, a six-year-old child typically weighs around 40 to 50 pounds. Wait, that's much lighter than 85 pounds. But I'm not sure if the weight is the only factor here. I remember something about pressure and how water pressure increases with depth. Maybe if the seawater is poured over the child, the pressure could cause more damage than just the weight.\n\nBut in this case, the question is about being crushed, which I think refers more to the weight. So, if ten gallons of seawater, weighing about 85 pounds, is placed on a child who is around 40-50 pounds, that's significantly heavier. I guess the child wouldn't be able to support that weight, leading to serious injury or being crushed.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Crushed usually means being compressed or squeezed. If the seawater is poured on top, it's more about the weight than compression. So, yes, the weight of the seawater would be enough to crush a six-year-old because it's more than double the child's weight. \n\nI think I've heard of water pressure in pools or oceans being dangerous, especially for young children. So, applying 85 pounds of force on a smaller body would definitely cause harm.\n</think>\n\nThe weight of ten gallons of seawater is approximately 85 pounds, which is significantly heavier than the typical weight of a six-year-old child (around 40-50 pounds). This weight difference could result in serious injury or being crushed. \n\n<answer>yes</answer>",
