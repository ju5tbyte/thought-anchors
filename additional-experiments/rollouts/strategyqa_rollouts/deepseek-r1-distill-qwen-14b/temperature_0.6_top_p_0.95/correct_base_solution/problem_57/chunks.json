  "source_text": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Would a week be enough time to watch every episode of Ugly Betty?\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if a week is enough time to watch every episode of Ugly Betty. Hmm, I don't know much about the show, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I should find out how many episodes Ugly Betty has. I think it's a TV series, right? I remember hearing it's based on a Colombian telenovela. Maybe it's pretty long. I'll check my memory\u2014wait, I think there are 105 episodes. Yeah, that sounds right because it's a pretty popular show and runs for several seasons.\n\nNow, a week has 7 days. If I want to watch all 105 episodes in a week, I need to see how many episodes I'd have to watch each day. Let me do the math: 105 divided by 7 equals 15. So, that's 15 episodes a day. That seems like a lot because each episode is about 45 minutes to an hour long.\n\nWait, let me think again. 15 episodes a day at 45 minutes each would be 15 times 0.75 hours, which is 11.25 hours a day. That's more than 11 hours of watching TV each day for a week. That's really intense and probably not feasible for most people because of daily activities, work, sleep, etc.\n\nBut maybe the user isn't considering all day watching. Perhaps they're asking hypothetically if it's possible, regardless of practicality. So, from a purely time perspective, if someone dedicated all their time to watching, could they do it? Let's see: 105 episodes times 45 minutes each is 4725 minutes. Divided by 7 days, that's about 675 minutes per day, which is 11.25 hours. So yes, it's possible if you watch non-stop without breaks, but it's not practical for most people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the series isn't as long as I thought. Wait, I'm not 100% sure about the number of episodes. Let me double-check. Ugly Betty, the American version, is based on the Colombian show 'El Tiempo de Vivir.' I think the U.S. version had four seasons. Let me count: Season 1 has 22 episodes, Season 2 has 22, Season 3 has 24, and Season 4 has 23. Adding those up: 22 + 22 is 44, plus 24 is 68, plus 23 is 91 episodes. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So maybe it's 91 episodes, not 105.\n\nIf it's 91 episodes, then 91 divided by 7 is 13 episodes a day. At 45 minutes each, that's 13 * 0.75 = 9.75 hours per day. Still a lot, but less than before. So even if it's 91 episodes, it's still a significant amount of time.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me confirm the number of episodes. I think the original Ugly Betty (the Colombian telenovela) is longer, but the American version is shorter. So perhaps the user is referring to the Colombian version, which I believe has around 130 episodes. That would make the calculation even more intense.\n\nSo, if it's 130 episodes, 130 / 7 \u2248 18.57 episodes a day. That's over 18 episodes, each about 45 minutes, totaling around 8.33 hours daily. That's even more time-consuming.\n\nBut maybe the user is asking about the U.S. version, which is 91 episodes. Either way, whether it's 91 or 130, watching all episodes in a week would require a lot of time each day.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the user is considering weekends or partial days. If they have weekends off, that's two days, so 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. But 91 episodes divided by 7 days is still 13 per day, which is a lot.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is thinking of watching multiple episodes in one sitting, but even so, 13 episodes a day is a stretch for most people.\n\nSo, considering all this, it's possible in terms of time if you dedicate every waking hour, but practically, it's not feasible for most people. The answer depends on whether we're talking about the Colombian or American version and the practicality of the schedule.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if a week is enough time to watch every episode of Ugly Betty, we need to consider the number of episodes and the time required. \n\n- The Colombian version of \"Ugly Betty\" (El Tiempo de Vivir) has around 130 episodes.\n- The American version has 91 episodes.\n\nAssuming a week has 7 days, we calculate the number of episodes per day:\n\n- For the Colombian version: 130 episodes \u00f7 7 \u2248 18.57 episodes per day.\n- For the American version: 91 episodes \u00f7 7 \u2248 13 episodes per day.\n\nEach episode is about 45 minutes long. Therefore:\n\n- Colombian version: 18.57 episodes \u00d7 0.75 hours \u2248 13.93 hours per day.\n- American version: 13 episodes \u00d7 0.75 hours \u2248 9.75 hours per day.\n\nBoth require significant daily commitment, making it impractical for most people. However, from a purely time perspective, it's possible if dedicated exclusively to watching.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>",
