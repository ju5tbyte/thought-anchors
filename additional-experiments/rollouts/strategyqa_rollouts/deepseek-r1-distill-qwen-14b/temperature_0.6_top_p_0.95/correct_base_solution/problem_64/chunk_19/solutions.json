Question: Could Lil Wayne legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career?\n<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Lil Wayne could legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career. Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out Lil Wayne's age when he started his career. I remember that he started pretty young. I think he was around 10 or 11 when he began rapping, right? He was part of The Cash Money Boyz, which later became The Hot Boys. So, if he started at 10, let's say in the late 80s or early 90s. Now, the legal driving age varies by place, but in the U.S., it's typically 16. Wait, but Lil Wayne is from New Orleans, Louisiana. I should check the legal driving age there. I believe Louisiana has a graduated licensing system, but the base age is 16 for a standard driver's license. Now, considering he was 10 when he started, he would be about 16 when he turned 16. So, in theory, he could get his driver's license at that point. But wait, he was already famous before turning 16, so maybe he had access to transportation earlier. However, legally, he couldn't drive alone until he was 16. But the question is about the beginning of his career. If he started at 10, he was under 16, so he couldn't legally drive on his own then. Unless he had a learner's permit, but even that usually requires being at least 15 or 16. So, without a valid license, he couldn't legally operate a vehicle alone at the beginning of his career. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nLil Wayne began his career around the age of 10. The legal driving age in Louisiana, where he is from, is 16.

Question: Could Lil Wayne legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career?\n<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Lil Wayne could legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career. Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out Lil Wayne's age when he started his career. I remember that he started pretty young. I think he was around 10 or 11 when he began rapping, right? He was part of The Cash Money Boyz, which later became The Hot Boys. So, if he started at 10, let's say in the late 80s or early 90s. Now, the legal driving age varies by place, but in the U.S., it's typically 16. Wait, but Lil Wayne is from New Orleans, Louisiana. I should check the legal driving age there. I believe Louisiana has a graduated licensing system, but the base age is 16 for a standard driver's license. Now, considering he was 10 when he started, he would be about 16 when he turned 16. So, in theory, he could get his driver's license at that point. But wait, he was already famous before turning 16, so maybe he had access to transportation earlier. However, legally, he couldn't drive alone until he was 16. But the question is about the beginning of his career. If he started at 10, he was under 16, so he couldn't legally drive on his own then. Unless he had a learner's permit, but even that usually requires being at least 15 or 16. So, without a valid license, he couldn't legally operate a vehicle alone at the beginning of his career. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nLil Wayne began his career at a very young age, around 10 years old. In the U.S., the legal driving age is typically 16, and in Louisiana, where he is from, the minimum age for a standard driver's license is 16.

Question: Could Lil Wayne legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career?\n<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Lil Wayne could legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career. Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out Lil Wayne's age when he started his career. I remember that he started pretty young. I think he was around 10 or 11 when he began rapping, right? He was part of The Cash Money Boyz, which later became The Hot Boys. So, if he started at 10, let's say in the late 80s or early 90s. Now, the legal driving age varies by place, but in the U.S., it's typically 16. Wait, but Lil Wayne is from New Orleans, Louisiana. I should check the legal driving age there. I believe Louisiana has a graduated licensing system, but the base age is 16 for a standard driver's license. Now, considering he was 10 when he started, he would be about 16 when he turned 16. So, in theory, he could get his driver's license at that point. But wait, he was already famous before turning 16, so maybe he had access to transportation earlier. However, legally, he couldn't drive alone until he was 16. But the question is about the beginning of his career. If he started at 10, he was under 16, so he couldn't legally drive on his own then. Unless he had a learner's permit, but even that usually requires being at least 15 or 16. So, without a valid license, he couldn't legally operate a vehicle alone at the beginning of his career. Therefore, the answer is no.\n</think>\n\nLil Wayne began his career around the age of 10 in the late 1980s. At that time, the legal driving age in Louisiana, where he is from, was 16.

First, I need to figure out Lil Wayne's age when he started his career. I remember that he started pretty young. I think he was around 10 or 11 when he began rapping, right? He was part of The Cash Money Boyz, which later became The Hot Boys. So, if he started at 10, let's say in the late 80s or early 90s. Now, the legal driving age varies by place, but in the U.S., it's typically 16. Wait, but Lil Wayne is from New Orleans, Louisiana. I should check the legal driving age there. I believe Louisiana has a graduated licensing system, but the base age is 16 for a standard driver's license. Now, considering he was 10 when he started, he would be about 16 when he turned 16. So, in theory, he could get his driver's license at that point. But wait, he was already famous before turning 16, so maybe he had access to transportation earlier. However, legally, he couldn't drive alone until he was 16. But the question is about the beginning of his career. If he started at 10, he was under 16, so he couldn't legally drive on his own then.
