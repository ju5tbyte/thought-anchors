Question: Could Lil Wayne legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career?\n<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Lil Wayne could legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career. Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out Lil Wayne's age when he started his career. I remember that he started pretty young. I think he was around 10 or 11 when he began rapping, right? He was part of The Cash Money Boyz, which later became The Hot Boys. So, if he started at 10, let's say in the late 80s or early 90s. Now, the legal driving age varies by place, but in the U.S., it's typically 16. Wait, but Lil Wayne is from New Orleans, Louisiana. I should check the legal driving age there. I believe Louisiana has a graduated licensing system, but the base age is 16 for a standard driver's license. Now, considering he was 10 when he started, he would be about 16 when he turned 16. So, in theory, he could get his driver's license at that point. But wait, he was already famous before turning 16, so maybe he had access to transportation earlier. However, legally, he couldn't drive alone before 16. So, at the very beginning of his career, when he was 10, he was definitely underage. But as his career progressed, he turned 16 and could legally drive. So, the question is specifically about the beginning of his career. Therefore, the answer would be no, he couldn't legally drive on his own at the start because he was too young.\n</think>\n\nAt the beginning of Lil Wayne's career, he was around 10 years old.

I think he was around 10 or 11 when he began rapping, right? He was part of The Cash Money Boyz, which later became The Hot Boys. So, if he started at 10, let's say in the late 80s or early 90s. Now, the legal driving age varies by place, but in the U.S., it's typically 16. Wait, but Lil Wayne is from New Orleans, Louisiana. I should check the legal driving age there. I believe Louisiana has a graduated licensing system, but the base age is 16 for a standard driver's license. Now, considering he was 10 when he started, he would be about 16 when he turned 16. So, in theory, he could get his driver's license at that point. But wait, he was already famous before turning 16, so maybe he had access to transportation earlier. But legally, he couldn't drive alone before 16. So, at the beginning of his career, when he was 10, he was definitely too young to drive on his own. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nLil Wayne began his career as a rapper at a very young age, around 10 years old.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out Lil Wayne's age when he started his career. I remember that he started pretty young. I think he was around 10 or 11 when he began rapping, right? He was part of The Cash Money Boyz, which later became The Hot Boys. So, if he started at 10, let's say in the late 80s or early 90s. Now, the legal driving age varies by place, but in the U.S., it's typically 16. Wait, but Lil Wayne is from New Orleans, Louisiana. I should check the legal driving age there. I believe Louisiana has a graduated licensing system, but the base age is 16 for a standard driver's license. Now, considering he was 10 when he started, he would be about 16 when he turned 16. So, in theory, he could get his driver's license at that point. But wait, he was already famous before turning 16, so maybe he had access to transportation earlier.
