So, unless he had a special permit, which is rare and usually for specific reasons like work, he wouldn't have been able to drive on his own. \n\nTherefore, at the beginning of his career, Lil Wayne was likely too young to legally operate a vehicle without a licensed adult present.

So, if he started at 10, let's say in the late 80s or early 90s. \n\nNow, the legal driving age in the United States varies by state, but I believe most states require you to be at least 16 to get a driver's license. Some states might allow younger drivers with certain restrictions, like a learner's permit and supervision by a parent or guardian. But generally, 16 is the minimum age.\n\nIf Lil Wayne was, say, 10 when he started his career, he would be way below the legal driving age. Even if he turned 16 later, the question is about the beginning of his career. So, at the very start, he was definitely underage. \n\nI'm also considering whether he might have had any special circumstances, like a work permit or something, but I don't think that affects the driving age. Plus, operating a vehicle on his own would require a valid license, which he wouldn't have until he was older. \n\nSo, putting it all together, since he was under 16 at the beginning of his career, he couldn't legally drive on his own. He might have been able to drive with supervision or with a permit, but not independently.\n</think>\n\nLil Wayne began his career around the age of 10, far below the typical legal driving age of 16 in the United States. Without a valid driver's license, he couldn't legally operate a vehicle on his own at that time. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",

I know that in most places, you can get a learner's permit around 14 or 15, and a full driver's license by 16 or 17. So, if Lil Wayne was 10 when he started, he would be a teenager by the time he was, say, 16. But could he legally drive on his own before that? \n\nI should check the minimum driving age. In the U.S., it's typically 16, but some states allow younger drivers with certain conditions. For example, some places let you drive with a learner's permit starting at 14 or 15, but you need supervision. So, if Lil Wayne was 16, he could get his license. But if he was driving on his own before that, it would be illegal unless he had a permit and was supervised.\n\nWait, but the question is about the beginning of his career. So, when he was starting out, he was very young. At 10, he couldn't drive at all. Even at 16, he could drive on his own, but before that, he needed a permit and supervision. So, if he was driving without a license or supervision before turning 16, that would be illegal.\n\nI think Lil Wayne didn't drive on his own until he was legally allowed. So, at the beginning of his career, when he was a kid, he couldn't legally drive on his own. Therefore, the answer would be no.\n</think>\n\nLil Wayne began his career as a young teenager, around the age of 10. At that time, the legal driving age in most places is 16, and even with a learner's permit, driving without supervision is typically not allowed. Therefore, Lil Wayne could not legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career.\n\n<answer>no</answer>",

So, if Lil Wayne was 10 when he started his career, he would still be around 16 or so when he was more established. Wait, but when exactly did he start gaining significant recognition? The Hot Boys were signed to Cash Money Records in the early '90s, so maybe by the mid-'90s Lil Wayne was in his late teens. \n\nLet me check his birthday. Lil Wayne was born on September 27, 1982. So, in 1992, he would be 10 years old. If he started his career around that time, by 1996, he'd be 14. Most states require a driver's license at 16, so by 1998, he'd be 16 and could legally drive. But the question is about the beginning of his career, which was in the early '90s. At that time, he was under 16. So, could he legally drive on his own? Probably not, because he wouldn't have a driver's license yet. \n\nWait, but maybe he had a learner's permit. Some states allow minors to drive with supervision, but the question is about operating a vehicle on his own. So, without a full license, he couldn't drive alone. Therefore, at the beginning of his career, he likely couldn't legally operate a vehicle on his own.\n</think>\n\nLil Wayne, born on September 27, 1982, began his career in the early 1990s, when he was around 10 years old. In the United States, the legal driving age typically starts at 16, with some states allowing younger individuals with a learner's permit under supervision. However, operating a vehicle on one's own without a full driver's license is not permitted. Since Lil Wayne was under 16 at the beginning of his career, he could not legally drive on his own. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",

But Lil Wayne, born Dwayne Carter Jr., was born in 1972, so by the time he was 10, he was in the early '80s. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because 1972 plus 10 is 1982. But his career started in the late '80s or early '90s. Let me get that straight.\n\nWait, no, if he was born in 1972, he turned 10 in 1982. But his music career started in the late '80s, maybe around 1989. So, he would have been around 17 or 18 when he started gaining significant attention. Wait, that doesn't add up. If he was born in 1972, in 1989, he'd be 17. So, if he started his career at 17, could he legally drive then? Well, in most states, 16 is the minimum age, so 17 is definitely old enough.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the beginning of his career. So, if he started when he was 17 or older, he could have a driver's license. But earlier in his career, when he was younger, like 10 or 11, he couldn't have driven legally. But the question is about the beginning of his career, so maybe around 17. So, yes, he could legally drive then.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about his exact age when he started. Let me check my facts. Lil Wayne was born on September 27, 1972. So, in 1989, he would be 16 years old. That's when he was signed to Cash Money Records. So, in 1989, he was 16. In many states, you can get a driver's license at 16, so he could have gotten his license around then. Therefore, at the beginning of his career, he was 16 and could legally drive, assuming he got his license on time.\n\nBut wait, some states require you to be 16 and pass the permit at 15. So, if he got his permit at 15, he could drive at 16 with a license. So, yes, by the time his career started, he was 16 and could drive legally.

Question: Could Lil Wayne legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career?\n<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Lil Wayne could legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career. Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out Lil Wayne's age when he started his career. I remember that he started pretty young. I think he was around 10 or 11 when he began rapping, right? He was part of The Cash Money Boyz, which later became The Hot Boys. So, if he started at 10, let's say in the late 80s or early 90s. \n\nNow, legal driving age varies by place, but in the US, most states require you to be at least 16 to get a driver's license, sometimes younger with a learner's permit and supervision. But Lil Wayne, born Dwayne Carter Jr., was born in 1972, so by the time he was 10, he was in the early '80s. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because 1972 plus 10 is 1982. But his career started in the late '80s or early '90s. Let me get that straight.\n\nWait, no, if he was born in 1972, he turned 10 in 1982. But his music career started in the late '80s, maybe around 1989. So, he would have been around 17 or 18 when he started gaining significant attention. Wait, that doesn't add up. If he was born in 1972, in 1989, he'd be 17. So, if he started his career at 17, could he legally drive then? Well, in most states, 16 is the minimum age, so 17 is definitely old enough.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the beginning of his career. So, if he started when he was 17 or older, he could have a driver's license. But earlier in his career, when he was younger, like 10 or 11, he couldn't have driven legally. But the question is about the beginning of his career, so maybe around 17. So, yes, he could legally drive then.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about his exact age when he started. Let me check my facts. Lil Wayne was born on September 27, 1972. So, in 1989, he would be 16 years old. That's when he was signed to Cash Money Records. So, in 1989, he was 16. In many states, you can get a driver's license at 16, so he could have gotten his license around then. Therefore, at the beginning of his career, he was 16 and could legally drive, assuming he got his license on time.\n\nBut wait, some states require you to be 16 and pass the permit at 15. So, if he got his permit at 15, he could drive at 16 with a license. So, yes, by the time his career started, he was 16 and could drive legally.
