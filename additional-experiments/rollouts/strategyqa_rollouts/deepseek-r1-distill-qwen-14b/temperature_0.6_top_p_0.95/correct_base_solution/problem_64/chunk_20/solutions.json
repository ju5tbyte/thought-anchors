Question: Could Lil Wayne legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career?\n<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Lil Wayne could legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career. Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out Lil Wayne's age when he started his career. I remember that he started pretty young. I think he was around 10 or 11 when he began rapping, right? He was part of The Cash Money Boyz, which later became The Hot Boys. So, if he started at 10, let's say in the late 80s or early 90s. Now, the legal driving age varies by place, but in the U.S., it's typically 16. Wait, but Lil Wayne is from New Orleans, Louisiana. I should check the legal driving age there. I believe Louisiana has a graduated licensing system, but the base age is 16 for a standard driver's license. Now, considering he was 10 when he started, he would be about 16 when he turned 16. So, in theory, he could get his driver's license at that point. But wait, he was already famous before turning 16, so maybe he had access to transportation earlier. However, legally, he couldn't drive alone until he was 16. But the question is about the beginning of his career. If he started at 10, he was under 16, so he couldn't legally drive on his own then. Unless he had a learner's permit, but even that usually requires being at least 15 or 16. So, without a valid license, he couldn't legally operate a vehicle alone at the beginning of his career. Wait, but maybe he had a commercial driver's license or something else? No, that's for bigger vehicles, and he's a rapper, so that's unlikely. So, putting it all together, he was too young to have a standard driver's license at the start of his career, so he couldn't legally drive alone then.\n</think>\n\nLil Wayne began his career at around age 10, which was before he turned 16.

First, I need to figure out Lil Wayne's age when he started his career. I remember that he started pretty young. I think he was around 10 or 11 when he began rapping, right? He was part of The Cash Money Boyz, which later became The Hot Boys. So, if he started at 10, let's say in the late 80s or early 90s. Now, the legal driving age varies by place, but in the U.S., it's typically 16. Wait, but Lil Wayne is from New Orleans, Louisiana. I should check the legal driving age there. I believe Louisiana has a graduated licensing system, but the base age is 16 for a standard driver's license. Now, considering he was 10 when he started, he would be about 16 when he turned 16. So, in theory, he could get his driver's license at that point. But wait, he was already famous before turning 16, so maybe he had access to transportation earlier. However, legally, he couldn't drive alone until he was 16. But the question is about the beginning of his career. If he started at 10, he was under 16, so he couldn't legally drive on his own then.

Question: Could Lil Wayne legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career?\n<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Lil Wayne could legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career. Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out Lil Wayne's age when he started his career. I remember that he started pretty young. I think he was around 10 or 11 when he began rapping, right? He was part of The Cash Money Boyz, which later became The Hot Boys. So, if he started at 10, let's say in the late 80s or early 90s. Now, the legal driving age varies by place, but in the U.S., it's typically 16. Wait, but Lil Wayne is from New Orleans, Louisiana. I should check the legal driving age there. I believe Louisiana has a graduated licensing system, but the base age is 16 for a standard driver's license. Now, considering he was 10 when he started, he would be about 16 when he turned 16. So, in theory, he could get his driver's license at that point. But wait, he was already famous before turning 16, so maybe he had access to transportation earlier. However, legally, he couldn't drive alone until he was 16. But the question is about the beginning of his career. If he started at 10, he was under 16, so he couldn't legally drive on his own then. Unless he had a learner's permit, but even that usually requires being at least 15 or 16. So, without a valid license, he couldn't legally operate a vehicle alone at the beginning of his career. Wait, but maybe he had a commercial driver's license or something else? No, that's not likely. So, putting it all together, he couldn't legally drive on his own at the start of his career because he was underage.\n</think>\n\nLil Wayne began his career at around age 10.

However, legally, he couldn't drive alone until he was 16. But the question is about the beginning of his career. If he started at 10, he was under 16, so he couldn't legally drive on his own then. Unless he had a learner's permit, but even that usually requires being at least 15 or 16. So, without a valid license, he couldn't legally operate a vehicle alone at the beginning of his career. Wait, but maybe he had a commercial driver's license or something else? That seems unlikely for a young rapper.

Question: Could Lil Wayne legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career?\n<think>\nOkay, so the question is whether Lil Wayne could legally operate a vehicle on his own at the beginning of his career. Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out Lil Wayne's age when he started his career. I remember that he started pretty young. I think he was around 10 or 11 when he began rapping, right? He was part of The Cash Money Boyz, which later became The Hot Boys. So, if he started at 10, let's say in the late 80s or early 90s. Now, the legal driving age varies by place, but in the U.S., it's typically 16. Wait, but Lil Wayne is from New Orleans, Louisiana. I should check the legal driving age there. I believe Louisiana has a graduated licensing system, but the base age is 16 for a standard driver's license. Now, considering he was 10 when he started, he would be about 16 when he turned 16. So, in theory, he could get his driver's license at that point. But wait, he was already famous before turning 16, so maybe he had access to transportation earlier. However, legally, he couldn't drive alone until he was 16. But the question is about the beginning of his career. If he started at 10, he was under 16, so he couldn't legally drive on his own then. Unless he had a learner's permit, but even that usually requires being at least 15 or 16. So, without a valid license, he couldn't legally operate a vehicle alone at the beginning of his career. Wait, but maybe he had a commercial driver's license or something else? No, that's for big trucks and requires more experience. So, probably not.
