  "source_text": "Answer the following yes/no question with step-by-step reasoning. You MUST end your response with <answer>yes</answer> or <answer>no</answer>. Question: Is shrimp scampi definitely free of plastic?\n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether shrimp scampi is definitely free of plastic. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that shrimp scampi is a dish, typically made with shrimp, olive oil, garlic, and sometimes white wine. But the question is about plastic. I'm thinking, where could plastic come into play here?\n\nWell, when you cook at home, you probably use ingredients you have. So, if someone is making shrimp scampi from scratch, they're probably not adding plastic intentionally. But wait, maybe the ingredients themselves could have plastic somehow? Like, maybe the shrimp comes in plastic packaging. But that's the packaging, not the food itself. So the actual shrimp wouldn't have plastic, right?\n\nBut then, what if the olive oil or other ingredients have microplastics? I've heard that microplastics are everywhere, even in bottled water and food. So if the olive oil or other components of the dish have microplastics, then technically, the shrimp scampi would have plastic in it. But is that a significant amount? I'm not sure.\n\nAlso, when cooking, sometimes you use utensils or cookware. If you're using plastic utensils or a plastic pan, maybe some plastic could transfer into the food. But I'm not certain how much that would affect the dish. It might be minimal, but it's still a possibility.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the dish is served with something plastic, like a disposable plate or utensils. But the question is about the dish itself, not the servingware. So I think that's separate.\n\nSo, considering all this, shrimp scampi isn't inherently made of plastic. The main ingredients are natural, but the possibility of microplastics in the ingredients and the use of plastic cookware or utensils could introduce plastic into the dish. However, it's not definite because it depends on the source of the ingredients and the cooking tools used.\n\nTherefore, I don't think shrimp scampi is definitely free of plastic because there are variables that could introduce plastic, even if it's not a major component.\n</think>\n\nShrimp scampi, typically made with shrimp, olive oil, garlic, and sometimes white wine, is not inherently made of plastic.

While the dish itself isn't made of plastic, it's not guaranteed to be entirely plastic-free due to these variables. \n\n<answer>no</answer>",
